In the
mean time I have significantly upgraded my use of the Org Mode Agenda,
which allows me to keep better track of the tasks that I’ve been
completing.  So first let’s talk about that.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="org-mode-upgrades"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Org mode upgrades</span></span></h1><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="basic-configuration-of-the-org-mode-agenda"><span class="firn-headline-text"><a class="firn-external" href="https://gist.github.com/holtzermann17/1c5b333a905b312f21da66db246159a6#org-mode-org-agenda" target="_blank">Basic configuration of the org mode agenda</a></span></h2><section><p><span>This something along these lines is what everyone will need to make
effective use of the Org Agenda.  I have added a few bonus features,

There were some cheats involved because this pulled out items that had
been marked </span><code>DONE</code><span> already.  But here’s what I came up with so far under
the ‘April’ section of the defined datetree mentioned above:</span></p><ul><li><p><code>WONTFIX</code><span> Evaluation: revisit old work</span></p></li><li><p><code>WONTFIX</code><span> 4PM Friday, meet on moral machines paper w/ overleaf outline</span></p></li><li><p><span>Send info to Topos asking them whether they want to be Project Partners</span></p></li><li><p><span>Cleaning up org files</span></p></li><li><p><span>Collate ‘Next Steps’ with Charlie’s spreadsheet</span></p></li><li><p><span>Review the Exp2Exp backlog to decide which things are wontfix, what other categories need to be created, etc.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Figure out subtasks to deliver for EmacsConf</span></p></li><li><p><span>Keep testing crdt.el and lockstep.el</span></p></li><li><p><span>Create a template and agenda for the ERG seminar</span></p></li><li><p><span>Outline(s) for small grants</span></p></li><li><p><span>Process comments from Reviewer 1</span></p></li><li><p><span>Collate ‘Next Steps’ with Charlie’s spreadsheet</span></p></li><li><p><span>Prepare next event for the ‘course’ and invite people</span></p></li></ul><p><span>I also set up a </span><a class="firn-internal" href="https://exp2exp.github.io/Writing">Writing</a><span> workflow that should help me stay focused, and made a little demo of a separate </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://gist.github.com/holtzermann17/4bf00a023e9ba1d7fd38d02abd641b42" target="_blank">Org Mode based content transformer</a><span>.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="week-ahead-tasks"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Week ahead tasks</span></span></h1><section><p><span>I still have some </span><code>TODO</code><span> items left over from last week.  Probably it
would be good to have these automatically marked as </span><code>DEFERRED</code><span>, but for
now they are just lagging around in the WIP list so I’ll keep at it.
This will work for now — though I should also go over the existing
todo lists and give them a solid brushing up, and spend some time
recording immediate tasks for the week in my journal.  As a way to get
back into the swing of things, though, this is plenty!</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Review the peeragogy backlog to decide which things are wontfix, what other categories need to be created, etc.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Work some more on the ‘poem’ version of the handbook</span></p></li><li><p><span>Turn the HCI Ethics treatment into a storyboard</span></p></li></ul></section></div></div></div><div><hr /><div class="backlinks"><h4>Backlinks to this document:</h4><ul class="firn-backlinks"><li class="firn-backlink"><a href="https://exp2exp.github.io/20200912223428-wiki">Wiki</a></li></ul></div></div><hr /><div class="back"><p>Back to blog: <a href="https://exp2exp.github.io/updates.html">Exp2Exp: Updates</a></p></div></article></main></body></html>
