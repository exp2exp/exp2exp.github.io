We’ve had interesting and varied guests, and some developing plans for the quarter ahead.  We’ve got a workflow with careful review and diagnosis of issues when expectations aren’t met.  Our work needs to be public first before we can embark on the next phase of this project — which is to mesh with ongoing related activities elsewhere.</span></p><p><span>If we tackle big enough projects, it will bring with it the need for collaboration (who, what is the itinerary; having places to talk about research?).  While we like to create tangible deliverables (e.g., journal articles, rather than half-baked/half-finished publications), “If we knew what the outcome was it wouldn’t be research” — and we want to keep a role for </span><em><span>serendipity</span></em><span> in our work. (Good to have some people holding the fort; we’re doing fine in terms of turn-out at weekly meetings!)</span></p><p><span>We have looked at RStudio as a model of (some of) the
kinds of things we want to do (would be great if we got
it up and running in a year... but this is a lot to ask).
‘Practice’ and ‘method’ keep coming up (respectively,
more bottom up and more top down ways of actualising what
we’re doing; focusing on what we’re actually doing, and
when we’re clear on that, we look at which settings are
the most conducive). E.g., one </span><em><span>method</span></em><span> would be: instead
of having a shared Org Roam directory, having ways of
managing sharing of notes across ‘graphs’. (Collaborative
work, academia, writing a book; have we seen </span><em><span>ORCiD.</span></em><span> If we
all had our slipboxes on there we. Finding these things
which are continually evolving. A Tinder for academics to
match people based on interest... Instead of paying money to go to conferences!  Now we can spontaneously make up conferences. $750.0)</span></p><p><span>What gives an objective character to what we’re doing?  (Noting also that time is going by; things that were timely 7 years ago might not be timely now; the actual relevance goes down.)  Or, rather: what is it that allows us to synthesise new relationships?  What big or ‘existential’ problem are we solving... we’re not pushing ourselves beyond what’s humanly possible, but we are pushing ourselves to learn.</span></p></blockquote><ul><li><p><span>If we had a shared document what would the audience look like?</span></p></li><li><p><span>Does this represent what we think?</span></p><ul><li><p><span>LV: JC’s ‘From the top’ really gave me conservatory PTSD</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>Maybe the chief issue in crossing disciplines is </span><em><span>vocabulary</span></em></p></li><li><p><span>Cross-disciplinary languages?</span></p><ul><li><p><span>How can I sit and absorb this language! — It involves being uncomfortable in new situations and being ready to be uncomfortable in these situations...</span></p></li><li><p><span>This relates to what we’re doing</span></p></li><li><p><span>When LV was talking about fuzzy-matching problems in SX for solutions; maybe we could have a similar approach to bridging the transdisciplinary gaps</span></p></li><li><p><span>JC related this to the fruitful relationship between Deleuze & Guattari</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>Similar to Hyperreal with their ‘four-handed’ method now 8 or 16 handed workflows</span></p></li><li><p><span>The rôle of indices, and their relationship to the slip-box method</span></p></li><li><p><span>Links to explore; possible people to work with?</span></p><ul><li><p><a class="firn-external" href="https://github.com/delaray" target="_blank">delaray (Pierre de Lacaze) · GitHub</a></p></li><li><p><a class="firn-external" href="https://github.com/delaray/babar" target="_blank">GitHub - delaray/babar: Babar is an independent research project in the field of Artificial Intelligence.

Requires some hygiene.  But if this is something people care about and that people use... then it is within the realm of what people use, it’s a way of going from the individual to the collective, that’s technologically backed, and also rewarding.</span></p><p><span>The issue of ‘permissions’ is important, this is why I brought up Orcid — you’d have a permanent ID, and you could give permission to share the things.  This is where 1+1=3...!</span></p><p><span>An easy step would be starting with people who you actually know — the ‘outreach’ could come after ‘output’ phase.</span></p><p><span>Permissions and attracting other people reminds Ray of what we had going on PlanetMath...</span></p><p><span>Now that other people have been pushing in this area, PlanetMath ideas are still relevant (to other people?) — maybe reinvesting some of the ‘soul’ of PlanetMath...</span></p><p><span>But also the PlanetMath community, philosophy, how we met in the first place.</span></p><p><span>LV: Less interested in “how to create something for others to see” — leave outreachu to communities like Reddit or something like this?</span></p><ul><li><p><span>We do have abilities to do R, elisp, and so on...</span></p></li><li><p><span>This is a huge difference from the way things were in October, when we were trying to do all the things that we aren’t trying to do now.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Leo: I’ve been influencing the direction of where this has been going b/c I’ve been thinking about trying to make a living doing this stuff, mapping this space of new skills... now maybe the need for a ‘research project’ or an ‘output’ has been tabled rather than erased.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Now we’re looking for enablement...</span></p></li></ul><p><span>Rather than saying that we lost track of outputs, we’re now a little more rational about what we can achieve; we’ve been discussing in a way that’s productive; the fact that we’re still there is a long/dense track record and we’re still feeling inspired.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>LV: probably wouldn’t be heading into the crowdfunding campaign...</span></p></li></ul><p><span>With these kinds of ‘backup’ ops we start with the real needs that people have (e.g., Leo’s crowdfunding campaign, Ray and Cameron’s coding needs, Noorah’s thesis writing)</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="emacsconf-use-case"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>EmacsConf use case</span></span></h1><section><p><span>We had all the videos split out; we are also able to extract time codes from BBB chat. I can write "Whoops, -5".  There’s a tag, so that 2 hours after the recording has been done with BBB we can slice the video and release it to the public.  With what we’re doing with the ERG meetings, if we were to assume a kind of back-office role, we could have those meetings then OPEN.  The first part being the chat, the second part being the research progress on topics.  If ERG was going to take a role where were expert users, there would be a lot of value of publishing the recordings... both for Leo, and for someone who is in the spotlight in the community.  The symbiotic..</span></p><p><span>Ray has been typing into Logseq while we are going, there’s a little project to improve it...</span></p><p><span>For Noorah, I do get a lot out of these meetings as a way to think about things, from a shelfish perspective it’s a place to take a break from my research!  And to switch to something else that I enjoy!  I don’t know how to materialise it: I am interested in building the system, collaborative networks, collaborative processes, that’s something I’m very interested in.  And Emacs is a great place to prototype ideas.</span></p><p><span>Keeping things based on impact and output. We struck a nice balance w/ input/output; also had a lot of high-level discussions about what collaboration in Org Roam would be.</span></p><p><span>Now it feels like we could back to having people over, as we did before!  Based on what David and Noorah did, we may need to implement an idea of co-development / co-creation that’s more grounded into the practical stuff.  Trying to figure out how we bring to life the collaborative slip box.</span></p><p><span>If in 2 months I’m financed with my kickstarter, I can see how much work I can put into this.  If we had a tag-up meeting that we can try out, just having this pattern of actualising the vision that we’ve been discussing...</span></p><p><span>Maybe the tension has been the high-level & the practical</span></p><p><span>RSP: I’m very interested in the things you’re saying about Org Roam; right now I’m using the tools I have, but later this year I’ll be working on the hypernotebooks.  Right now I’m busy getting the math and physics done, but later this year planning to be getting back to programming and setting up the computer and so on. If I hear a little bit every week I have time to let it sink in, and prepare for when I do get back to it.</span></p><p><span>So, not an idea of moving 80% to practical stuff, but having a slow-cooking thing.  It might not be serendipity if we’re intending — maybe it’s a metal detector — but if we try using the software and looking for improvement, we can share it on YouTube ... it can connect people.  This is probably the right way to do it</span></p><p><span>Mini Emacs-Rocks?</span></p><p><span>5 minute lightning talks?</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="crdt-feature-requests"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>crdt feature-requests</span></span></h1><section><ul><li><p><span>Ways to act on the view-port</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Asking for focus</span></p></li><li><p><span>Keybinding that can switch us to the next person</span></p></li><li><p><span>instead of having to switch to the buffer</span></p></li><li><p><span>Modeline indicator</span></p></li></ul></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="rel-with-ogm"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>rel. with OGM</span></span></h1><section><ul><li><p><span>OGMConf?</span></p></li><li><p><span>Fee?</span></p></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="org-roam-feature-requests"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>org-roam feature-requests</span></span></h1><section><ul><li><p><span>collaborative slip-boes & org-roam-server</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Thinking with intersections / Venn diagrams</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>Test-driven, relate to implementations, relate to other</span></p></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="par"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>PAR</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#10m">10m</a></span></span></h1><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="1-review-the-intention:-what-do-we-expect-to-learn-or-make-together?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>1.
