adjustments to our Logseq + Org Roam installation, with (e.g.,</span><code>.dir-locals.el</code><span> set up so that the next time we use Org Roam it will
“just work”; also Logseq changed their link format which required some
updating in our draft notes).  I wonder if building in a “heads up”
display for new Emacs users could be helpful!  I personally can’t
remember all of the default bindings in Org Roam, and with Doom/Evil I
am even more naive.</span></p><p><span>Other achievements were task breakdowns for several of the workflows
that I am involved with.  Some of these have relevant </span><strong><span>deadlines</span></strong><span> that
should be added into my own (paper-based) heads-up display!</span></p><p><span>I spent a little time on Sunday messing around with Firn, which seems
to be part of several different critical paths.  Linking between
subdirectories now works; I made a few bug reports that had been
outstanding, and did QA for a clever patch that someone submitted that
fixed links in headlines, and also added some examples to the docs.  I
played around some with the CSS, getting something reasonable in order
as a first step towards integrating special blocks in Tufte-style
sidebars.  Next steps on the coding side are slated for Wednesday 10th
February (lunch time Toronto!).</span></p><p><span>At Brookes I was in touch with some of the research support staff who
offered to set me up with a research mentor.  That’s now secured!  By
mid-week I reached out to him to arrange an initial discussion.  I
should also remember to drop a line to some of the informal contacts
that I spotted when I was just looking around to see who could do some
mentoring.</span></p><p><span>Lastly, I did the initial technical edit on the first mix of our
Discord chats about secular dharma.  That would need some further
editing to be publishable.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="other"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Other</span></span></h1><section><p><span>Turns out I caught a cold at the end of this week so that slowed me
