on/in/with Emacs back in October 2020.</span></p><p><span>We’ve met almost every week since then, and interviewed some
interesting and varied guests. We have a clearer idea of what what we
want to talk about at the next EmacsConf, and how we can be of service
to researchers and Emacs users. We have been using a workflow that
helps us carefully review progress and diagnose issues. The next phase
of this project is to “go public” and mesh with ongoing related
activities elsewhere.</span></p><p><span>If we tackle big enough projects, it will bring with it the need for
collaboration. We like to create tangible deliverables (e.g., journal
articles). However, “If we knew what the outcome was it wouldn’t be
research” — therefore, we’re focusing initially on research methods
and design documents. That may mean it takes us a bit longer to write
our first paper, but when we get something out it will be
good. Meanwhile we’re also keeping sharp by fixing bugs, filing
issues, improving our own workflows, and actively exploring the
landscape. We want to keep a role for serendipity here, which adds the
requirement that our planning process remain open and flexible:
including to various disciplinary methods, and especially to change as
we reflect on how things are going.</span></p><p><span>We have looked at RStudio and Roam Research as models of (some of) the
kinds of things we think Emacs can eventually improve upon. ‘Practice’
and ‘method’ keep coming up in our discussions as, respectively, ‘more
bottom up’ and ‘more top down’ ways of actualising things. Concretely,
we’ve been studying our own processes and looking for the tools and
settings that are the most conducive to the work we want to do. For
example, instead of having a single Org Roam directory shared via Git,
what if we had ways of managing sharing of notes across ‘graphs’?</span></p><p><span>Collaboration is familiar to in all kinds of teams across all
sectors. Even authors working alone may have need to ‘virtually
collaborate with themselves’ — and of course to share their work with
others when it’s ready. If we all had our slipboxes online, we could
reference between them. This would generalise ORCiD, and people to
reference processes that are undergoing evolution. Maybe a service
like this would turn into a ‘Tinder for academics’ — helping to match
people based on their interests (or similar people in different
fields). So, what’s the price point? Instead of paying money to go to
conferences, now we can spontaneously make conferences and
workshops. As a guess, $750.0 per user per year might be a fair price
— for those who can afford to pay it — if the service helps people to
do better research and saves a bunch of travel. We could also set up a
pricing model proportional to each country’s carbon emissions or
something like that.</span></p><p><span>In our concrete methods, we have aligned ourselves with the ‘long-term
perspective’. This includes both retrospective and prospective
thinking. For example, the things that were timely 7 years ago might
not be so timely now; in many the relevance of a given innovation goes
down over time. However, Emacs has an evolutionary character that has
allowed it to keep up with the times — becoming more relevant and
useful ever since Steele and Stallman started to systematise Editor
MACroS for the Text Editor and Corrector (TECO). Not only has the
technology evolved, but so has the social setting in which this work
is done. Whereas the concepts underlying the free software movement
were based on “communal sharing” of source code, with due reflection
these methods extend much more broadly, and allow us to synthesise new
relationships within ecological, semiotic, and genetic commons. Much
like the Universal Turing Machine is a system for modelling any
machine, Emacs can become a system for addresssing any ‘existential’
problem. This does not yet push us beyond what’s humanly possible, but
may expand the frontier of possibility.</span></p></blockquote></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="cla:-demo-of-evidentiary-workflow"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>CLA: demo of evidentiary workflow</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#20m">20m</a></span></span></h2></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="extra-topic-1"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Extra topic 1</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#30m">30m</a></span></span></h2></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="par"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>PAR</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#15m">15m</a></span></span></h1><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="1-review-the-intention:-what-do-we-expect-to-learn-or-make-together?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>1.
