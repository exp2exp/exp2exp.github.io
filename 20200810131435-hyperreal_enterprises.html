intelligence</span></em><span> is used almost everywhere, but artificial intelligence is
used almost nowhere.  AI can kick butt at Chess and Go, but university
courses are still taught by human professors.  Heck, code is still written
by human programmers.  Surely, AI that could write code at a human level
would be a valuable thing?</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="so-where’s-the-human-level-ai-for-coding?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>So where’s the human-level AI for coding?</span></span></h2><section><p><span>A research agenda around “AI for programming” was already spelled out
by Alan Turing in the late 1940s.  It is only relatively recently that
we have massive amounts of relevant data ready to work with.  Code
completion and code generation tools are some of the “low hanging
fruit” in this domain.  However, we think that something much more
substantial is around the corner.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="so-we-are-looking-into-it"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>So we are looking into it.</span></span></h2><section><p><span>Our evolving cast of characters brings together applied experience in
Natural Language Processing (NLP), computational modelling, online
communities, mathematical sciences ($x!$) as well as humanities and
social science.  We’ve been getting together for daily coffee chats,
and sharing information and skills with each other in online seminars.
Sometimes we bring in guest speakers.  We trying to structure things
so that as time goes by our chats will coalesce into notes, blog
posts, papers, and working prototypes.  We aren’t promising a schedule
of deliverables.  We’re all volunteers, typically with other
paying jobs, sometimes in the process of looking for them!
We’re doing this for fun and interest.  We plan to share what we’re learning as we go along!</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="broadly,-the-steps-we-have-in-mind-move-from-data,-to-models,-to-ai-agents"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Broadly, the steps we have in mind move from data, to models, to AI agents.</span></span></h2><section><p><span>We plan to document our progress (or lack thereof) on this blog.  As a
very rough outline:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>We’d like to use contemporary information extraction methods to derive computationally meaningful material from sources like Stack Exchange Q&A, Github Issues, and programmers’ discussions, along with code. To do this, we will combine general purpose language models, like ELECTRA, and a knowledge graph approach.</span></p></li><li><p><span>We’d like to use category theoretic methods as a glue that can hold together a range of computational models, including models of programs and the process of computer programming. </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.05691" target="_blank">Monocl</a><span> is one such an existing process modelling language that has been used to create an abstraction layer over a collection of </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://www.datascienceontology.org/" target="_blank">data science programs</a><span>: we’d like to generalise this approach.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Ultimately, we plan to install the models in computational agents who can then “converse with each other to sharpen their wits” (as Turing anticipated), mirroring contemporary developments in self-play.  However, the specific design of the agents remains an open issue at the moment!  Here, we’d like to explore techniques from Bayesian learning, logic programming, and reinforcement learning.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>The path forward may be much less linear than these three bullet points would suggest.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="reflection-is-a-big-part-of-the-process"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Reflection is a big part of the process.</span></span></h2><section><p><span>We’re interested in understanding human behaviour as well as technical
topics.  That goes for our own behaviour in particular.  We plan to
keep this wiki up to date and use it as a place to reflect honestly on
how things are going.  Although we’re grappling with some weighty
topics, ‘success’ in this domain is not all or nothing!  Writing here
will mark our progress and be useful in their own right (e.g., blog
posts can potentially feed into research papers or tools, or at
minimum help us manage our workflow).</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="progress-so-far"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Progress so far</span></span></h2><section><p><span>Alongside setting up a blog and drafting an initial anouncement
(voilà!), we’ve updated the website of our affiliated UK-based
company </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://hyperreal.enterprises/" target="_blank">Hyperreal Enterprises</a><span> with an agenda that matches the outlines
of we’ve described here.  As mentioned above, are having
regular meetings, which we may record if they look likely to be
interesting to a wider audience.  Other stuff:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>We’re working on tools and processes that can improve our efficacy, for example, we gave a short </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://github.com/exp2exp/ob-servant" target="_blank">talk</a><span> at </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://emacsconf.org/2020/" target="_blank">EmacsConf 2020</a><span> about some of the Emacs-based data-and-computation wrangling tools we’ve been working on.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Also following up on EmacsConf we’ve started an additional weekly seminar, the “</span><a class="firn-internal" href="https://exp2exp.github.io/erg">Emacs Research Group</a><span>”, which has been quite disciplined about taking notes, and developing a focused </span><a class="firn-internal" href="https://exp2exp.github.io/cla-12-april-2021">plan of work</a><span>.</span></p></li><li><p><span>We submitted a </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://hyperreal.enterprises/nnexus.html" target="_blank">grant proposal</a><span> (with colleagues at Oxford Brookes) to the </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/epsrc-mathematical-sciences-small-grants-scheme/" target="_blank">EPSRC mathematical sciences small grants scheme</a><span> that would support half a year of work on the data-facing part of the pipeline.</span></p></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="tl;dr"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>TL;DR</span></span></h2><section><p><span>We are working on creating AI tools that will process open source
