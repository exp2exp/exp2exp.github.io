OpenAI of GPT-3 generating Python code and JSX web page layouts were
circulated in 2020 — but in practice, word models themselves do not
contain the fine-grained structural information needed to process the
deep semantics of most code or mathematical text.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="relationship-to-the-context"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Relationship to the context</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#ignore">ignore</a></span></span></h2><section><p><span>This proposal will provide the early proofs-of-concept applications
