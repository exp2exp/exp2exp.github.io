questions available from sites like 4Clojure.  But the solver hasn’t
really been that much in scope for any of the things we’ve been
working on yet!  However, Ray looked at some classic work on
rule-based solutions to subtraction problems, and I’d say that
something along these lines could be created for solving Clojure koans
(each of which is mainly meant to teach a specific rule, anyway).  I’m
sure it would be helpful for me to get more practice, and this time,
include a careful writeup of the ‘rules’ I follow.</span></p></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="navigation"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Navigation</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#noexport">noexport</a></span></span></h1><section><p><span>HEL topic: </span><a class="firn-internal" href="https://exp2exp.github.io/../20200810135851-how_to_design_programs_with_if">How to Design Programs</a></p><p><span>Next: </span><a class="firn-internal" href="https://exp2exp.github.io/study_with_crowdsourced_exercises">Study with crowdsourced exercises</a></p></section></div></div></div><div><hr /><div class="backlinks"><h4>Backlinks to this document:</h4><ul class="firn-backlinks"><li class="firn-backlink"><a href="https://exp2exp.github.io/index">index</a></li></ul></div></div></article></main></body></html>
