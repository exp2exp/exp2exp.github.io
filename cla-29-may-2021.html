helps us carefully review progress, diagnose issues, and manage our
energy.  The next phase of this project is to “go public” and mesh
with ongoing related activities elsewhere.</span></p></blockquote></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="back-maintain-plans-for-the-next-six-months"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>BACK Maintain plans for the next six months</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#breakdown">breakdown</a></span></span></h3><section><ul><li><p><span>We are doing research</span></p></li><li><p><span>Some more directly related to Emacs</span></p></li><li><p><span>Some with guests</span></p></li><li><p><span>Some ‘user’ and “market” research</span></p></li><li><p><span>Backlink to: </span><a href="#peeragogy:roadmap"></a></p></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="back-keep-doing-pars-and-clas"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>BACK Keep doing PARs and CLAs</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#breakdown">breakdown</a></span></span></h3><section><ul><li><p><span>This is our thing about method</span></p></li><li><p><span>Maybe we should be expanding this to patterns...?</span></p></li><li><p><span>This could be about presenting ‘futures’ in Patterns</span></p><ul><li><p><span>NB: in Typescript work, there was a nice description of patterns</span></p></li><li><p><span>They talked about how we shouldn’t blindly internalise them</span></p></li></ul></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="back-mesh-with-other-ongoing-activities-elsewhere"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>BACK Mesh with other ongoing activities elsewhere</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#breakdown">breakdown</a></span></span></h3><section><ul><li><p><span>Stakeholders are much bigger group</span></p></li><li><p><span>Diversity of guests</span></p></li><li><p><span>Diversity of outreach (maybe some kids in London haven’t heard about programmers...)</span></p></li><li><p><span>Mike wants to develop virtual assistant stack</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Do users have to write Org Mode?</span></p></li><li><p><span>How can we offload some work to less-expert employees?</span></p></li><li><p><span>What’s the relationship to time, expertise, serendipity?</span></p></li><li><p><span>What’s relationship to ongoing Hyperreal activities?</span></p></li><li><p><span>To discuss more next week...</span></p></li></ul></li></ul></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><h4 class="firn-headline firn-headline-4" id="back-come-up-with-a-categorical-treatment-of-todo-categories"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>BACK Come up with a categorical treatment of todo-categories</span></span></h4></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="data"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Data</span></span></h3><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><h4 class="firn-headline firn-headline-4" id="supporting-data-from-cla-4"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Supporting data from CLA 4</span></span></h4><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-5"><h5 class="firn-headline firn-headline-5" id="we-heard-some-about-the-energy-and-time-costs-of-leo’s-typescript-learning-sprint"><span class="firn-headline-text"><a class="firn-internal" href="https://exp2exp.github.io/erg-2021-04-24#we-heard-some-about-the-energy-and-time-costs-of-leo’s-typescript-learning-sprint">We heard some about the energy and time costs of Leo’s Typescript learning sprint</a></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#ep19">ep19</a></span></span></h5></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-5"><h5 class="firn-headline firn-headline-5" id="(leo-has-still-participated,-though-wishes-he’d-be-able-to-muster-more-forces)"><span class="firn-headline-text"><a class="firn-internal" href="https://exp2exp.github.io/erg-2021-04-24#(leo-has-still-participated,-though-wishes-he’d-be-able-to-muster-more-forces)">(Leo has still participated, though wishes he’d be able to muster more forces.)</a></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#ep19">ep19</a></span></span></h5><section><ul><li><p><span>TBA</span></p></li></ul></section></div></div></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="systemic-approaches-and-solutions-(social-system)"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Systemic approaches and solutions (social system)</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#system">system</a></span></span></h2><section><blockquote><p><span>If we tackle big enough projects, it will bring with it the need for
collaboration.  We like to create tangible deliverables (e.g., journal
articles).  However, “If we knew what the outcome was it wouldn’t be
research” — therefore, we’re focusing initially on </span><em><span>research methods</span></em><span>
and </span><em><span>design documents</span></em><span>.  That may mean it takes us a bit longer to write
our first paper, but when we get something out it will be good.
Meanwhile we’re also keeping sharp by fixing bugs, filing issues,
improving our own workflows, and actively exploring the landscape.  We
want to keep a role for serendipity here, which adds the requirement
that our planning process remain open and flexible: including to
various disciplinary methods, and especially to change as we reflect
on how things are going.</span></p></blockquote></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="back-identify-potential-stakeholders-in-emacs-research"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>BACK Identify potential stakeholders in Emacs Research</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#breakdown">breakdown</a></span></span></h3><section><ul><li><p><span>‘Org Notes’ for some potential USERS</span></p></li><li><p><span>Other potential users, also some people we can talk to as market/user research (Not all stakeholders are users.)</span></p></li><li><p><span>Org Roam</span></p></li><li><p><span>Zanzi’s Smos stuff, Qiantan’s S-EXP based editor, treesitter stuff</span></p></li><li><p><span>Standardising Org?

kinds of things we think Emacs can eventually improve upon.
‘Practice’ and ‘method’ keep coming up in our discussions as,
respectively, ‘more bottom up’ and ‘more top down’ ways of actualising
things.  Concretely, we’ve been studying our own processes and looking
for the tools and settings that are the most conducive to the work we
want to do.  For example, instead of having a single Org Roam
directory shared via Git, what if we had ways of managing sharing of
notes across ‘graphs’?</span></p><p><span>Collaboration is familiar to in all kinds of teams across all sectors.
Even authors working alone may have need to ‘virtually collaborate
with themselves’ — and of course to share their work with others when
it’s ready.  If we all had our slipboxes online, we could reference
between them.  This would generalise </span><strong><span>ORCiD</span></strong><span>, and people to reference
processes that are undergoing evolution.  Maybe a service like this
would turn into a ‘Tinder for academics’ — helping to match people
based on their interests (or similar people in different fields).  So,
what’s the price point?  Instead of paying money to go to conferences,
now we can spontaneously make conferences and workshops.  As a guess,
$750.0 per user per year might be a fair price — for those who can
afford to pay it — if the service helps people to do better research
and saves a bunch of travel.  We could also set up a pricing model
proportional to each country’s carbon emissions or something like
that.</span></p></blockquote></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="back-spec-out-the-emacs-based-‘answer’-to-rstudio,-roam-research-(not-logseq)"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>BACK Spec out the Emacs based ‘answer’ to RStudio, Roam Research (not Logseq)</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#breakdown">breakdown</a></span></span></h3><section><ul><li><p><span> (It would be great if we got the next big thing up and running in a year... but this is a lot to ask.)</span></p></li><li><p><span>But what would the “next big thing” look like at the level of, say, an ERC proposal?</span></p></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="back-develop-our-own-intention-based-workflow"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>BACK Develop our own intention-based workflow</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#breakdown">breakdown</a></span></span></h3><section><ul><li><p><span>[x] Surfacing the experimental ground</span></p></li><li><p><span>[ ] What else?</span></p></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="back-continue-to-develop-and-refine-our-methods"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>BACK Continue to develop and refine our methods</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#breakdown">breakdown</a></span></span></h3><section><ul><li><p><span>This is already incorporated with the PAR and CLA (that’s actionable)</span></p></li><li><p><span>So would be doubling down here with a paper on our methods for PLoP</span></p></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="back-develop-a-suitable-collaborative-writing-workflow-for-a-specific-shared-output"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>BACK Develop a suitable collaborative writing workflow for a specific shared output</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#breakdown">breakdown</a></span></span></h3></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="back-think-about-the-product-and-business-development-plans-for-a-multigraph-interlinking-service"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>BACK Think about the product and business development plans for a multigraph interlinking service</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#breakdown">breakdown</a></span></span></h3><section><ul><li><p><span>Inyatullah would want us to think critically about what we’re saying in this document.</span></p></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="back-something-similar-with-pete-kaminsky-and-lauralie-‘matching’"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>BACK Something similar with Pete Kaminsky and Lauralie ‘matching’</span></span></h3><section><ul><li><p><span>Harder to do soul-matching...</span></p></li><li><p><span>It’s not just what they need to go but what you need to avoid (or, which half of the room?)</span></p></li><li><p><span>Use the friend magnetism to attract people (GravPad?)</span></p></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="data"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Data</span></span></h3><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><h4 class="firn-headline firn-headline-4" id="supporting-data-from-cla-4"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Supporting data from CLA 4</span></span></h4><section><ul><li><p><span>TBA</span></p></li></ul></section></div></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="myths,-metaphors-and-narratives:-imagined-(longer-term-change)"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Myths, metaphors and narratives: imagined (longer term change)</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#narrative">narrative</a></span></span></h2><section><blockquote><p><span>In our concrete methods, we have aligned ourselves with the ‘</span><a class="firn-external" href="https://longtermist.substack.com/" target="_blank">long-term
perspective</a><span>’.  This includes both retrospective and prospective
thinking.  For example, the things that were timely 7 years ago might
not be so timely now; in many cases the relevance of a given
innovation goes down over time.  However, Emacs has an evolutionary
character that has allowed it to keep up with the times — becoming
more relevant and useful ever since Steele and Stallman started to
systematise </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://www.oreilly.com/openbook/freedom/ch06.html" target="_blank">Editor MACroS</a><span> for the Text Editor and Corrector (TECO)
program.  Not only has the technology evolved, but so has the social
setting in which this work is done.  Whereas the concepts underlying
the free software movement were based on “</span><a class="firn-external" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-paper.html" target="_blank">communal sharing</a><span>” of source
code, with due reflection these methods extend much more broadly, and
allow us to synthesise new relationships within broader semiotic
commons.  Emacs can become a system for addressing any ‘existential’
problem.  This does not yet push us beyond what’s humanly possible,
but may expand the frontier of possibility.</span></p></blockquote></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="back-survey-related-work"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>BACK Survey related work</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#breakdown">breakdown</a></span></span></h3></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="back-assess-what-we’re-learning"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>BACK Assess what we’re learning</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#breakdown">breakdown</a></span></span></h3></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="back-figure-out-the-gender-balance-stuff"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>BACK Figure out the gender balance stuff</span></span></h3></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="data"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Data</span></span></h3><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><h4 class="firn-headline firn-headline-4" id="supporting-data-from-cla-4"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Supporting data from CLA 4</span></span></h4><section><ul><li><p><span>TBA</span></p></li></ul></section></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><hr /><div class="backlinks"><h4>Backlinks to this document:</h4><ul class="firn-backlinks"><li class="firn-backlink"><a href="https://exp2exp.github.io/cla-16-october-2021">CLA 16 October 2021</a></li></ul></div></div><hr /><div class="back"><p>Back to blog: <a href="https://exp2exp.github.io/erg">Exp2Exp: ERG notes</a></p></div></article></main></body><script>anchors.options = {
