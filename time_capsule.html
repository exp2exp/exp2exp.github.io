Enterprises.  The mist has been turning back and forth
into rain all morning, but it finally settled down in
the early afternoon.  Inside, the small staff of
mostly Icelandic researchers are hard at work, mony of
them hacking away at their workstations.  A seminar is
taking place in the seminar room.  It is, in fact,
business as usual at "Heck" - as the offices are
colloquially known.</span></p><p><span>The place looks mostly like you would expect for an
early 21st century technology firm based in a
Scandinavian country.  Modern, but not cheap.
Utilitarian, but comfortable.  (Nicer, even,
than Ikia.)</span></p><p><span>HE officially opened its doors here in Reykjavik on
January 15, 2011.  The company is owned collectively
by the employees.  This could theoretically have made
these folks some of the richest people in the world,
if they hadn't agreed in their founding documents to
keep everyone's wage in sync with that of the
Reykjavik Postmaster General.  Most of the company's
earnings are spent funding the work of independent
contractors - other programmers, engineers and
researchers, as well as transport and warehouse
personnel working in various countries.  Then there is
the technology budget, also significant.  Electricity
is of course inexpensive, and the building and grounds
are owned by HE.</span></p><p><span>Happy April Fools day ya'll!  I wrote this for you last
night, sorry if it isn't fun or funny.</span></p><p><span>Here are some open-ended Reading Comprehension questions.</span></p><ol><li><p><span> Why the "Heck"?</span></p></li><li><p><span> Where did Hyperreal Enterprises get its startup capital?</span></p></li><li><p><span> Why is Hyperreal Enterprises based in Iceland?</span></p></li><li><p><span> Are the programmers mentioned in paragraph 1 male or female?</span></p></li><li><p><span> Why January 15, 2011?</span></p></li><li><p><span> What is about to happen in the story (if anything)?</span></p></li></ol><p><span>Best answers receive a free copy of a better short science function story by E.

of this particuar centre is to further the development of Kyle's
theorem prover.  By now, JACKYL has moved far beyond showing that
10 is even and has settled several major conjectures in number
theory.</span></p><p><code>2.</code><span> Where did Hyperreal Enterprises get its startup capital?</span></p><p><span>By special arrangement with the New University of Tahiti, they
had a fundraiser in which they sold Tahiti treat.  Another
important source of revenue was the money associated with prizes
for solving the conjectures.</span></p><p><code>3.</code><span> Why is Hyperreal Enterprises based in Iceland?</span></p><p><span>Because Icelanders love Tahiti treat.  One bite of the stuff
and you'll think you're lounging on the beach of a tropical
island instead of watching the icebergs go by a frozen fjord.
In fact the headquarters of Hyperreal Enterprises used to be an old
post office, but the postmaster agreed to donate them to Hyperreal
Enterprises in exchange for a lifetime supply of Tahitian treat.</span></p><p><code>4.</code><span> Are the programmers mentioned in paragraph 1 male or female?</span></p><p><span>Neither. (trick question) Those people are not programmers -- the
computers program themselves.  The people busily typing away at
terminals are actually mathematicians whom the computers are
questioning in order to build up the knowledge base.</span></p><p><code>5.</code><span> Why January 15, 2011?</span></p><p><span>Originally, it was supposed to open in 2010 with the unveling of
Deep black 10 in the year of the Space Oddyssey.  However a geyser
blew up and flooded the building, so the opening had to wait until
the building could be dried out.  Hence the opening date got
pushed up to January 1, 2011.  However, since Icelanders take
their winter holidays seriously and celebrate 13 days of
Christmas, the opening had to wait until a week after Thor blot
(which marks the end of Yule season).</span></p><p><code>6.</code><span> What is about to happen in the story (if anything)?</span></p><p><span>We will organize a conference on computer-based mathematics and
ask the University of Iceland if they would agree to host it.  Upon
seeing that the organizers do not have the proper academic
credentials to organize a conference in this field, they flatly
refuse to have anything to do with us.  So we go to our good
friend the postmaster, who gladly lets us use the training centre
for mailmen and arranges for a special stamp to be printed in
honor of the First Nordic Conference on the Hyperreal Dictionary
of Mathematics.  (As it turns out, not many of these stamps get
used because conference registration is electronic and the
proceedings are pulished on Asteriod Meta.)</span></p><p><span>The conference will be a big success with a list of speakers that
reads like a who's who of computer science.  For weeks afterwards,
one can hear disgruntled professors in the departments of computer
science and mathematics of the University of Iceland grumbling how
a group of amateurs cheated them out of the glory that was
rightly theirs.</span></p><p><span>This story will be used as a benchmark for reading comprehension programs.</span></p></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="reply-to-ray"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Reply to Ray</span></span></h2><section><blockquote><p><span>> Best answers receive a free copy of a better short science function

    Headquarters.  It is, moreover, another word for a door latch
    (i.e. what you need to use to open or close a door; perhaps even a
    metaphorical door needs a metaphorical doorlatch), or a door
    itself; or a "latticework contrivance for catching fish" (i.e. a
    sort of a net).  Can also be written "hack".  Finally, there are
    other nice meanings related to weaving, or the meandering of a
    stream, or, of course, to a sort of purgatory or hell (compare
    "The Matrix", esp. part II).</span></p></li><li><p><span> By winning prize money, like you said.  Which means we're going to

    Icelanders.  At least, that's what I think I read; they may have

    in an interesting direction from there, maybe try "Fremder" by
    (one of my favorite authors) Russell Hoban.  But really, I have no
    idea where things would go.  If we could really "do" math in 5
    years, and, say, world business in another 5 or 10, it completely
    boggles </span><u><span>my</span></u><span> mind to think what we'd be doing next.  I say, one
    step at a time.  The expression parser isn't even finished; maybe
    even "just started", I'm not sure.  But at least one day out of
