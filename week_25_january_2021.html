Scrum board.  For a week, I kept it up to date each day by ‘carrying’
completed tickets off into the ‘completed’ section.  I also have been
trying to write short (150 word) entries into my personal diary (US:
daily planner).  Over the weekend, I took all the tickets that I
completed last week, and wrote a page in my long-form writing journal.
I’ve now typed up the results.  I was thinking that this might be
enough to move towards a “blog post” (e.g., four of </span><em><span>these</span></em><span> per month
could perhaps be edited into something a bit more serious).  Broadly,
I think we’ve not been as good at moving from conversations and chats
to the kinds of things that have more communicative power as we
thought we might be at the outset of this project!  But, for me this
constitutes a quantum leap forward.  I think there could be some
exciting — collaborative, software-based — extensions of this workflow
within the next few months.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>We did an initial analysis of PARs collected by the Emacs Research
Group.  Currently this exists in note form at </span><a class="firn-internal" href="https://exp2exp.github.io/erg/cla-16-january-2021">CLA 16 January 2021</a><span> and
elsewhere.  Regarding *ARs, it’s worth having a look at a Harvard
Business Review article that Cameron found.</span></p><p><span>I wrote to the FSF’s CTO Ruben about the NSF grant, but didn’t hear
back immediately!  We could think more about how to target our
outreach: that said, Topos is interested to continue discussing this
stuff.  Maybe we can find some common ground there.</span></p><p><span>I set up an meeting with the Brookes research Office, scheduled for
Thursday, 28 January 2:00 – 3:00pm (though I will ask them if I can
push it to 3PM).  So, I can chat with them about that and my typed up
EPSRC short-grant proposals (see </span><a class="firn-internal" href="https://exp2exp.github.io/first_draft_of_two_short_mathematical_science_research_grant_proposals">First Draft of two "Mathematical
Sciences Small Grant" Research Proposals</a><span>).</span></p><p><span>In the Peeragogy Handbook v4, I’ve created some editorial-director
style notes for revision </span><strong><span>up to</span></strong><span> the section on "Practice".  It would be
great to do the rest of the sections on ‘patterns’ in one focused
session, and it would probably take about </span><strong><span>5 hours or most of 1 working day</span></strong><span> to do that.</span></p><p><span>I wrote 3 MSc project descriptions (see </span><a class="firn-internal" href="https://exp2exp.github.io/possible_student_projects">Possible student projects</a><span>),
and they were reasonably well received by my colleagues.  (No specific
notes for revisions.  The topics are all “doable”, with concrete
technical deliverables, which were appreciated.</span></p><p><span>Also, I prepared and sent off a 400 word abstract on </span><em><span>serendipity</span></em><span> for
the Serendipity and Big Data workshop that’s coming up next month.
I’ve started to chase through all of the old reviewer reports ond
previous submissions, adding notes with Org Roam.  Again, it would be
good to set aside </span><strong><span>5 hours</span></strong><span> or so to devote to that this week to see how
I get on.</span></p><p><span>Lastly, I made some initial arrangements about AIDAN, emailing people
about talks, preparing the initial schedule for meetings, and
analysing the survey of interested persons.  That, itself, comprised a
fun warm-up for my first day of teaching on “Survey Fundamentals”.</span></p></section></div></div></div><hr /><div class="back"><p>Back to blog: <a href="https://exp2exp.github.io/updates.html">Exp2Exp: Updates</a></p></div></article></main></body></html>
