Bristol?</span></p><p><span>• Potential OUTPUTS: (we could envision several options graded as
"amazing", "OK", and "minimally acceptable"... recalling that the ESRG
session that we went to was an example of a "workshop", but it was not
really an acceptable prototype from our viewpoint: both Abby and Joe
wanted something more engaging.)</span></p><p><span>Some examples:</span></p><p><span>E.g., not just a "workshop" in terms of a one-day event but using that
day to prototype a WORKSHOP (LIKE A CARPENTRY WORKSHOP) that changes
and develops over time after the one-day event.  For instance, the
Workshop activities could be centred around a map, with different
aspects of "health" recorded on it.  Later, if people want to learn
how to make a healthy city, in Coventry or Canterbury, they might
decide to visit Bristol and learn how!</span></p><p><span>E.g., What does it mean to create a diverse planted bed in a town
square?  If we have time to do this... maybe we could prototype our
way towards doing it as an exhibition at Arnofini... translating to a
mockup of the town square in the gallery space.</span></p><p><span>E.g., also,</span></p><p><span>• Better understandings of the interactions of professionals
• Visual output sketching
• A relatively accessible wiki</span></p><p><span>Compare work by Geoffrey Thun <gthun@umich.edu>, from Detroit: they
required a skilled GIS operator, they held workshops to get people in
and give feedback on whether they'd captured things with their maps.
The work involved establishing Living Labs, e.g., in Japan. They are
spaces for sharing ideas that involve citizens coming and working
together.  What does a Living Lab look like?  How would it be
sustained?  Perhaps we could put forward an Artist’s Residency, e.g.,
where we rent the gallery space for a longer period... take over the
space for a prolonged period of time; and/or make a moving
installation where we invite different experts/citizens to start to
move the picture around from place to place, and change its components
(cf. assemblage theory).</span></p><p><span>Rather than using GIS, maybe we could do something similar with a
knowledge map?  This would require some pre-work to map the domain.</span></p><p><span>Later we want to enable people to put their own inputs into the
resource, remotely/asyncronously?</span></p><p><span>We could introduce the platform as a technical approach to capturing a
knowledge map.</span></p><p><span>Objective of the workshop might be "inventing practices and sharing
these practices", so that they can be worked on even after the
workshop is over?  So, not just a platform for knowledge sharing, but
for charting the course of actions. So they could share INTENTIONAL
ACTION and keep track of updates?</span></p><p><span>E.g., the Detroit group organized around a "food, energy, water" nexus
— but "health" is missing and the presumption is that health somehow
falls out of that combination.  But actually, we think that health is
central, and the above nexus underpins planetary health.  We can look
specifically from a health perspective.</span></p><p><span>PATTERNS (and the work by pattern folks) can feel inward-looking.
There’s a reason why they have stagnated in architecture!  Ben Bolgar
and Sergio Porta gavie interesting talks at IMCL which were somehow
"pattern inspired", and David Brain also... however, they aren’t
pinning themselves to patterns; their work has other structures that
organize it.</span></p><p><span>The ESRG folks had their own agenda; in particular, Michael wanted to
continue CA’s legacy, but that becomes difficult when you’re working
with contemporary architects and civilians.</span></p><p><span>We’d like to talk further with Setha Low as well?  Both David and
Setha have in common the sociology/anthropology orientation.  Asking
"how do people use their space, and how do they engage with that?"</span></p><p><span>So, for us, an interesting challenge is how to relate the mind map or
knowledge graph to spacial arrangements?  E.g., asking participants,
how would you create space to live in?  And, how do we ACTUALLY make
real these sketches?  Perhaps we could get started with some embodied
activities with Claire van Rhyn in the afternoon session?
"Translating into action"... fits nicely with the "enacting" view that
we wanted to archieve.</span></p></blockquote></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="follow-up?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Follow-up?</span></span></h2><section><ul><li><p><span>Establish core working group</span></p></li><li><p><span>Wiki deliverable Design</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Features: sustainability/longevity</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>Wiki deliverable Prototype</span></p></li><li><p><span>Pilot workshop?</span></p></li></ul><p><span>We’ve bought into the idea that Emacs allows us to do what we want to
do better.  There are some features that were missing, like CRDT.
We’ve now been making use of it in every meeting.  If we’re to sell
people on having proficient tools, we need to talk with them about
what they do.</span></p><p><span>If we try to sell people on "Emacs" it will look like something for
writing code or something antiquated... we’ll get stuck.  But we could
progressively sell people by showing people what’s possible.  What can
we present with the workflow that we have?</span></p><p><span>We talked about ERG, we talked about how we work together; and we can
sell people on the METHOD.  We can talk about how we use Emacs to do
stuff, and we can show it.  They might not replicate what we do
immediately, but we could catalogue patterns that can be easily
accessed.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>We require experts with the model to run the workshop, who have bought into Emacs [and PLACARD?] already</span></p></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="our-goal"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Our goal</span></span></h2><section><ul><li><p><span>Essentialise it to something that’s valuable</span></p></li><li><p><span>E.g., CLA is similarly liberating compared with CRDT</span></p></li><li><p><span>How can we implement new design ideas, like word-highlighting?

So, the selling point is developing methods, that get people to reach the essence of what they have in common</span></p><ul><li><p><span>The tools we use support this, but we could use different tools; if we ran 3 workshops, w/ 3 articles for each, we could then distill the commonalities.

homelessness, but we could try to find the wrinkles that they
generated in Houston.  We can be experts on our specialties + Emacs.
We can bank on the fact that we have entrypoints & the culture to
understand the outward aspect of the project.  Our goal: be able to be
inserted into any setting, dropped in w/ others, find the gaps w/
other aspects, find the questions that get the conversation moving
