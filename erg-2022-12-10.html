anything like that in Org Roam UI</span></p></li><li><p><span>It could be something simple like </span><em><span>frequency of words</span></em><span> to test the strength of connection: which would only be applied to neighbouring nodes</span></p></li><li><p><span>Read into network analysis, they have done stuff like this before</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Quadratic (e.g., 100x100) at worst case</span></p></li><li><p><span>But this does go to linguistic ideas</span></p></li><li><p><span>We can think more about how to do this well</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>If you have many lines going out of it you could at least say "This one is instrumental to others"</span></p></li><li><p><span>This is a constant time!</span></p></li><li><p><span>Tech question: if I open org-roam.db

column</span></p></li><li><p><span>Text data is currently stored in file, but it would be easier for analysis if we had the full-text data inside</span></p></li><li><p><span>LV: Though, from data-hygiene standpoint, it's considered better to keep only metadata in the database! ‚Äî Otherwise computation vs database writes is tricky</span></p></li><li><p><span>Maybe I need a python script that extracts the text from each node & puts it into compute</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>"Datalake" might be a tech thing we could use</span></p></li><li><p><span>Expanding the local neighbourhood of new nodes could be useful for thinking about "what's missing" that would make our new insights more effective & more valuable</span></p></li><li><p><span>Think about this in terms of "activation" ‚Äî you might be more likely to create more links in an already-densely-connected area</span></p></li><li><p><span>Another route: exclude distance 2, but see connections that aren't obvious (not distance 3 but w/ high salience)</span></p></li><li><p><span>E.g., also, "retract nodes that are already well connected, so that we only see the new
