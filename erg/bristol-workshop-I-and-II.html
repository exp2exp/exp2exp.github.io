together a group of people who haven’t worked together before, get
them onto the same page, and generate a path for collaborative action.</span></p><p><span>We want our methods to be transferable between contexts.  Topics we’re
currently exploring include </span><em><span>public space</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>free software</span></em><span> and</span><em><span>anticipatory methods</span></em><span>.  We envision these topics weaving together in
the future around larger and longer scale collaboration around massive
problems.</span></p></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="phase-one"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Phase One</span></span></h2><section><p><span>In the first phase of the workshop we build a shared understand the
context and relationships that exist in that context.  We use
interactive activities to scaffold the process.  The result will be a
set of </span><strong><span>scenarios</span></strong><span> and </span><strong><span>dimensions</span></strong><span>.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="phase-two"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Phase Two</span></span></h2><section><p><span>The second phase of the workshop, we ask participants to take on roles
that explore the scenarios.  Our aim is to create an </span><strong><span>orientation to
action</span></strong><span> that will outlive the workshop itself.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="summary-of-methods"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Summary of Methods</span></span></h2><section><ul><li><p><span>[ ] </span><strong><span>Causal Layered Analysis.</span></strong><span>  In both phases of the workshop we think in terms of CLA’s four layers: Litany, System, Worldview, and Myth.  In Phase 1, the output of each preceeding layers feeds into the next one; when we get to the Myths later, we have a shared perspective.  We then work our way back through the previous layers in the second phase of the workshop, envisioning a new Litany (e.g., future newspaper headlines).</span></p></li><li><p><span>[ ] </span><strong><span>Design Patterns.</span></strong><span> The defined sets of problems that participants are used to solving comprise a simple ‘design pattern language’.  </span><em><span>Prior to the workshop</span></em><span>: we should do some background research on participants to develop hypotheses about what their patterns might look like.  </span><strong><span>(This is especially important as a way to bring in themes and approaches that are important to the workshop sponsors!)</span></strong><span> </span><em><span>During the workshop</span></em><span>: we will refactor these patterns to bring about new ways of working.</span></p></li><li><p><span>[ ] </span><strong><span>Project Action Review.</span></strong><span>  In this setting we want to ask people to imagine </span><em><span>future actions</span></em><span>, with attention to unexpected perturbations and variations (e.g., what can go wrong, what they might have to learn, things they might need to make, etc.).</span></p></li></ul></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="scenario-building-activities"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Scenario building activities</span></span></h1><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="before-the-workshop-to-litany"><span class="firn-headline-text"><em><span>Before the workshop to Litany</span></em></span></h2><section><blockquote><p><span>\noindent </span><strong><span>Solo Activity:</span></strong><span> </span><strong><span>Dérive Comix</span></strong><span> (2 hours max)</span></p><p><span>Walk for one hour around your neighbourhood.
