methods</span><a class="firn-footnote-ref" href="#" id="fn-"><sup></sup></a><span> to bring together a group of people
who haven’t worked together before, get them onto the same page, and
scaffold collaborative action.</span></p><p><span>We want our methods to be transferable between contexts.  Topics we’re
currently exploring include </span><em><span>public space</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>anticipatory methods</span></em><span>, and</span><em><span>the future of free software</span></em><span>.  We envision these topics eventually
weaving together around larger and longer scale collaboration around
massive problems.</span></p><p><span>Our workshop has three phases, and ideally we would have several hours
to run it, though with adaptations it can be run in less than an hour.</span></p></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="phase-one"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Phase One</span></span></h2><section><p><span>In the first phase of the workshop we build a shared understanding of
the context and relationships that exist in that context.  We use

In Phase 1, the output of each preceeding layers feeds into the next one; when we get to the Myths later, we have a shared perspective.  We then work our way back through the previous layers in the second phase of the workshop, envisioning a new Litany (e.g., future newspaper headlines).</span></p></li><li><p><span>[ ] </span><strong><span>Design Patterns.</span></strong><span> The defined sets of problems that participants are used to solving comprise a simple ‘design pattern language’.  </span><em><span>Prior to the workshop</span></em><span>: we should do some background research on participants to develop hypotheses about what their patterns might look like.  </span><strong><span>(This is especially important as a way to bring in themes, approaches, and hypotheses that are important to the workshop sponsors!)</span></strong><span> </span><em><span>During the workshop</span></em><span>: we will refactor these patterns to bring about new ways of working.</span></p></li><li><p><span>[ ] </span><strong><span>Project Action Review.</span></strong><span>  In this setting we want to ask people to imagine </span><em><span>future actions</span></em><span>, with attention to unexpected perturbations and variations (e.g., what can go wrong, what they might have to learn, things they might need to make, etc.).</span></p></li></ul><p><span>Further details are available in a separate preprint.</span><a class="firn-footnote-ref" href="#" id="fn-"><sup></sup></a><span> We’ve distilled the main things that
participants will need to know into several short handbooks, included
here as Appendices </span><a href="#analyst"></a><span>, </span><a href="#historian"></a><span>, </span><a href="#kaiju"></a><span>, and </span><a href="#designer"></a><span>.)  Indeed,
partipants will only need to familiarize themselves with one of these,
and we can do that during the workshop itself.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="related-work"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Related work</span></span></h2><section><p><span>Our methods, derive from experience with the Peeragogy project, particularly our use of design patterns, project action reviews, and short trainings for multiple roles.</span><a class="firn-footnote-ref" href="#" id="fn-"><sup></sup></a><span>  Although the specific methodological synthesis is unique, we are not the only people working on related topics.  Here we limit ourselves to a few examples:</span></p><ul><li><p><a class="firn-external" href="https://doughnuteconomics.org/about-doughnut-economics" target="_blank">Doughnut Economics</a><span> — “the Doughnut offers a vision of what it means
  for humanity to thrive in the 21st century - and Doughnut Economics
  explores the mindset and ways of thinking needed to get us there.”
  More specifically: “The social foundation forms an inner boundary,
  below which are many dimensions of human deprivation. The
  environmental ceiling forms an outer boundary, beyond which are many
  dimensions of environmental degradation.”</span></p></li><li><p><a class="firn-external" href="https://earthwatch.org/" target="_blank">Earthwatch</a><span> — “connects people with scientists worldwide to conduct
  environmental research and empowers them with the knowledge they
  need to conserve the planet.”</span></p></li></ul><p><span>Like the proponents of these efforts, we are steeped in the values of
citizen science and open research.j  We also believe that our methods
can scaffold complex interactions between citizens and experts, to
achieve more integrated action than traditional conservation and
development projects.  Thus, we can help to further and consolidate
the aims of projects like the above.</span></p><p><span>Nevertheless, we should be clear that this point of view is currently
somewhat speculative.  Each of our patterns represents a hypothesis
that can be tested in practice and refined.  This document is an
evolving record of that process.</span></p></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="before-the-workshop"><span class="firn-headline-text"><em><span>Before the workshop</span></em></span></h1><section><p><span>As mentioned, the workshop organizers should do some background
research on project participants and prepare some simple design
pattern descriptions based on their public profiles.  We can make use
an analogy between this four-part adaptation of the pattern template:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>Problem ... Solution ... Rationale ... Actions ...</span></p></blockquote><p><span>and the four CLA layers to frame the patterns.</span></p><p><span>Our client for the public space workshop, Abby Tabor, suggested three
themes, which we've translated into patterns and immediate next steps,
using the DPL template.  We also have developed some patterns in
advance of our Anticipation 2022 workshop, which play a similar role
in that context.  These patterns presented in the subsections below as
indicative examples.  Further brief examples of patterns can be found

‘nature’ in the way that Serres asks us to, given our tendency to

Social structures
also change how we think about boundaries: forexample, consider the

things in a new way and can encourage the health of the whole.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><h4 class="firn-headline firn-headline-4" id="rationale"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Rationale</span></span></h4><section><p><span>To see ourselves as part of a greater whole is step towards radical
action.  Everyone has access to a way experiencing the world in which
"We stop imputing the sense of solidity that creates a sense of
separation [and yet] do not shut off the senses in any way. Actually,
we shed the veneer, the films of confusion, of opinion, of judgment,
of our conditioning, so that we can see the way things really
are"</span><a class="firn-footnote-ref" href="#" id="fn-"><sup></sup></a><span> </span><span> This necessarily happens
"interfaced with the phenomenal world" </span><span> Living creatures have a tendency to be biased towards
precise information, even if this information isn’t true.  Dissolving
boundaries can allow more holistic informative patterns to take shape.

research methodology for examining a topic of concern at four layers
that he refers to as the </span><em><span>litany</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>system</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>worldview</span></em><span> and </span><em><span>myth</span></em><span>.  In
developing a CLA, none of the four layers is privileged over the
others, nor are they examined in isolation.  Rather, one moves between
them, examining how they relate to one another.  One can then
integrate these insights to form a more comprehensive basis for
understanding what is happening in the present and for anticipating
the future.  The sections below begin by describing each of the four
layers according to the following schema:</span></p><ul><li><p><strong><span>Contents</span></strong><span>: </span><em><span>What is found in this layer?</span></em></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Analysis</span></strong><span>: </span><em><span>Techniques for analysis of this layer.</span></em></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Literature</span></strong><span>: </span><em><span>Instances of texts which are typically operative at this layer.</span></em></p></li></ul><p><span>The sections then proceed by developing a running example, to further
illustrate the four layers and show how such an analysis might
proceed.  We conclude with some further discussion and an example of
the kind of tableau that an Analyst might develop in the </span><strong><span>Back to
reality</span></strong><span> exercise (</span><a href="#worldview-to-systems"></a><span>).</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="cla-by-example"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>CLA by example</span></span></h2><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="litany"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Litany</span></span></h3><section><ul><li><p><span>Contents :: Observable facts, events, and quantitative trends.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Analysis :: Minimal processing of data.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Literature :: News reports, tax filings, chit-chat.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>\noindent </span><strong><span>Example:</span></strong><span> Gasp! An Evil Genius has occupied the Ashmolean museum.  All
entrances are barred shut, no-one can get in or out.  For a few weeks
this persists---despite efforts at blockading the premises and
shutting off utilities, somehow the occupiers are not being starved
out and are not letting up.  The press and the authorities are baffled
as how and why this is going on!  It seems that the occupiers are not
interested in making public statements or demanding ransom or anything
of the sort---apparently all they want to do is to have the museum to
themselves and camp out there.  After a few week, documents from the
museum and detailed plans and images of artefacts from the museum
circulate on the web and museum-quality replicas of artefacts from the
Ashmolean appear in third-world countries.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="system"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>System</span></span></h3><section><ul><li><p><span>Contents   :: The social, economic, political, and historical forces which shape events.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Analysis   :: Technical explanations and interpretation of data within a given paradigm.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Literature :: Editorials and policy institute reports.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>\noindent </span><strong><span>Example:</span></strong><span> Advances in scanning and printing technology make it possible to
produce copies of artefacts indistinguishable form the original.
Moreover, since the information is stored and transmitted digitally,
anyone with a suitable printer anywhere can make themselves a copy.  A
system of tunnels allowed the occupiers to evade the blockade and keep
themselves supplied.  The security system originally designed to keep
terrorists from damaging the priceless treasures was instead used to
protect the "terrorists" against the "authorities" "besieging" the
museum.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="worldview"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Worldview</span></span></h3><section><ul><li><p><span>Contents :: Core values and attitudes which motivate choices and actions.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Analysis :: Uncover deep assumptions and study the mental and linguistic constructs which undergird how people interact with each other and their surroundings.

worldviews. “What is an artefact?”: Is it an object which plays a role
in rituals and gift networks?  Is it a source of data for scientific
investigations of the past?  Is it a part of an artistic and cultural
heritage?  Who should own the artefact: The heirs of the people who
originally made it?  Those with the power and wealth to acquire it?
Those who have the facilities to curate and study it?  Where is the
value: Is it spritual?  Is it social?  Is it economic?  Is it
scientific?  Is it artistic?  Does it specially inhere in the original
or can a copy share in the value under certain circumstances?</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="myth"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Myth</span></span></h3><section><ul><li><p><span>Contents :: The symbols and tales which give meaning to life.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Analysis  :: Study symbols and narratives, and the myths and rituals within which they participate.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Literature :: Poetry, art, anthropology, Jungian analysis.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>\noindent </span><strong><span>Example:</span></strong><span> In this setting, there is a corresponding clash/clang of
myths.  We have the myths of the people who made the artefact and the
metaphors which it expressed for them.  We have the "manifest destiny"
and "white man's burden" myths of the colonizers who collected the
artefacts and sent them to the museum.  We have the more secular myths
of people who admire, study and care for the artefacts in the museum
today, treasuring them as expressions of the human spirit which
continue to serve as a source of meaning and inspiration.</span></p></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="applying-cla-thinking-to-critiquing-the-cooling-the-commons-patterns"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Applying CLA thinking to critiquing the Cooling the Commons patterns</span></span></h2><section><p><span>The 41 patterns developed by the ‘Cooling the Commons’ initiative
include examples like \textsc{The Night-Time Commons}, which:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>… might shift daytime activities into cooler night times. Some places
already have these patterns: night markets and night-time use of
outdoor spaces. If locally adapted versions of these patterns
encourage people to adopt new habits, other patterns will be
needed. These will include, for example, ways to remind those cooling
off outdoors in the evening that others might be trying to sleep with
their naturally ventilating windows open. Such interlinked patterns
point to the way pattern thinking moves from the big scale to the
small.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Reading this, we were concerned that, while the Cooling the Commons
patterns do acknowledge “horizontal complexity”—namely, through
interlinked patterns—the process does not deal with the “vertical
complexity” coming from the fact that diurnal rhythms are deeply
embedded in biology and culture. People have cultural beliefs about
the activities that are appropriate for different times of day. Public
and domestic rituals are organized about the daily cycle. Times of day
have symbolic associations. As far as we could tell, these authors
focused on more or less technical issues at the systems level, and did
not acknowledge these issues at the worldview and myth levels. A more
comprehensive approach might, for instance, re-examine rituals to see
which of them relate to the phenomenon of sunrise versus the act of
getting up and starting the day, and then figuring out how to adapt
these rituals to a new schedule. A suitable research strategy might be
to study how practices changed in the past, as with the introduction
of industrialization and its clockwork regimentation of the day.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="example-shareback-tableau"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Example shareback tableau</span></span></h2><section><p><strong><span>Litany</span></strong><span>: The dispossessed outside the glass wall</span></p><p><span>\noindent </span><strong><span>System</span></strong><span>: Profit motive replaces social care</span></p><p><span>\noindent </span><strong><span>Worldview</span></strong><span>: The counterculture rises</span></p><p><span>\noindent </span><strong><span>Myth</span></strong><span>: Accessible Clean Water for Recreation</span></p></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="historian’s-handbook"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Historian’s Handbook</span></span></h1><section><p></p><p><span>Example timeline from Radical Transformation in a Distributed Society — Neo-Carbon Energy Scenarios 2050.

trips under 5km distance. They are an important, cost-effective means of
reducing traffic density and promoting healthy exercise. Community-based

transport. For instance, </span><em><span>Bike Marrickville</span></em><span> is a volunteer-run group
of residents promoting cycling and improving the local environment.

organisation and residents are responsible for existing public trees and
new ones, after which local government authorities take over caring for
them. Those first five years are vitally important if the trees, planted
and existing, are to be healthy and long-lived. During this time, the
community and development organisation can establish policies and
strategies for site trees, so that local government can continue with
the foundational tree management afterwards, including the on-going
appointment of a respected arboriculturalist.</span></p><p><span>Often people are afraid of big trees in public spaces or private gardens
because they may drop branches or fall on cars or houses in severe
storms. This can be addressed by </span><strong><span>consistent arboriculture care</span></strong><span> (for
instance visit the Arboriculture Australia website in resources
section). Trees can be encouraged to grow in particular shapes to remain
amenable to social commoning. There are various stages to caring for
trees so that branches do not fall, and trees remain healthy.</span></p><p><strong><span>First, trees need deep friable soil, air and water</span></strong><span>. For trees in open
space, start with the Keyline method of preparing planting areas (see
the KEYLINE pattern). This will ensure healthy soil and water for good
growth. Tree planting in streets and public space need adequate areas
and depth of soil (see the pattern SELECTING SHADE TREES FOR PUBLIC OPEN
SPACE)</span></p><p><strong><span>Second, check and manage trees for insect pests</span></strong><span> Providing the proper
cultural care in accordance with climate and needs of a tree species is
the best way to prevent insect infestations. Eucalyptus trees, for
instance, appreciate supplemental irrigation during prolonged dry spells
and experts at the University of California Integrated Pest Management
Program suggest watering eucalyptus plants once a month with a drip hose
until the top 12 inches of soil become moistened and performing
maintenance pruning when pests are waiting out the winter season, in
order to avoid attracting insects into freshly cut wood tissue (see
Kelsey [n.d.] in the references below).</span></p><p><strong><span>Third, prune and maintain branch and trunk health</span></strong><span> to keep structural
soundness to withstand storms and strong winds. This can include
reducing the weight of the canopy by selectively pruning the ends of the
branches.</span></p><p><strong><span>Cable and brace</span></strong><span> where branches need more support or have been damaged.
Cabling keeps tree branches from splitting at their junction. This
involves attaching various types of cables to stronger branches, the
trunk, the ground or other anchors. Cabling can also be used to support
unusually long limbs or reinforce weak-wooded species.</span></p><p><strong><span>Dynamic Cabling</span></strong><span> (or </span><strong><em><span>‘Cobra'</span></em></strong><span>) allows the limbs to sway, putting less
stress on trunk and branches. Thus, tree continues to produce </span><strong><span>reaction
wood</span></strong><span> (special cells) in response to wind or other stresses.  Dynamic
systems generally use synthetic ropes instead of cables, and they
usually wrap rubber around the branches being supported, rather than
relying on metal hardware that has been screwed into the tree.  </span><strong><span>Cobra
system</span></strong><span> is a dynamic tree support system specially designed to be
flexible and shock-absorbing with different benefits:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Gentle to trees, self-adjusting to the diameter growth of tree,
  requires practically no tools, and incorporates a shock-absorbing
  unit;</span></p></li><li><p><span>Avoids defective growth, the ‘karate effect', abrasion and
  constriction, wounding;</span></p></li><li><p><span>Encourages trees to grow reaction wood.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>Cobra system components include cobra rope, anti-friction hose,
expansion insert, shock absorbers (Arbor Culture Pty Ltd, n.d.)</span></p><p><strong><span>Crown thinning and lifting</span></strong><span> allows more sunlight to pass and air to
flow through the canopy. This is done by removing some secondary
branches. Crown lifting raises the height of the crown and allows more
space underneath for lawns and gardens.</span></p><p><strong><span>Good Arboriculturalists can undertake these procedures and maintain
your trees with annual inspections.</span></strong></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><h4 class="firn-headline firn-headline-4" id="pattern-conditions"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Pattern Conditions</span></span></h4><section><p><strong><span>Enablers:</span></strong></p><ul><li><p><span>Undergrounding powerlines means trees can grow full mature form.

reate turbulence on both sides of solid barriers. This contrasts with

turbulence. Groves of trees, rather than rows, effectively channel
prevailing winds and achieve greatest density of canopy when species are
mixed.</span></p><p><strong><span>Canopy Density</span></strong><span> is increased when trees are crowded; crown branching
