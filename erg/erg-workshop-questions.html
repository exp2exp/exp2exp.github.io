\addcontentsline{chapter}{Introduction}</span></p><p><span>Here we outline questions and activities related to the first phase of
the overall workshop design.  Our aim is to understand the context and
relationships that exist in that context.  To do this, we ask a series
of questions to participants.  To make it more fun and to get some
richer information, we use interactive activities to scaffold the
process of answering these questions.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="cla-questions-for-workshop"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>CLA questions for workshop</span></span></h1><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="todo-before-the-workshop-to-litany"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>TODO Before the workshop to Litany</span></span></h2><section><ul><li><p><span>We need to gather data on participants.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>UPGRADE</span></strong><span>: If participants have one or more defined sets of routine problems that they tend to think about, this could take the role of a ‘design pattern language’.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Example: In our pilot workshop, we used the </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://www.coolingthecommons.com/" target="_blank">Cooling the Commons</a><span> pattern language.</span></p></li></ul></li></ul></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="litany"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Litany</span></span></h3><section><blockquote><p><span>\noindent </span><strong><span>Solo Activity:</span></strong><span> Dérive Comix (2 hours max)</span></p><p><span>Walk for one hour around your neighbourhood.  Address the following
questions, possibly documenting them with photos or video clips.  (You
can prepare in advance by reading this short intro to the </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://www.publicstreet.org/derive" target="_blank">dérive</a><span>.
Please follow up by preparing your materials to share, e.g., as
slides, sketches, a zine, a map, or some PostIt notes.)</span></p></blockquote><ul><li><p><span>What are you observing? (sight, sound, smell)</span></p></li><li><p><span>What do we </span><em><span>already</span></em><span> see? (What are the obvious things? What are the particular sites of meaning, e.g., a bowl that is more than just ‘a bowl’?)</span></p></li><li><p><span>What are you experiencing? (feelings, thoughts, first impressions)</span></p></li><li><p><span>Make a timeline of your experiences on the walk.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>UPGRADE</span></strong><span>: The Celts pray using the every day (such as making a fire or milking a cow); they don’t separate time for prayer and time for life.  In a faith perspective, this is an incarnational model (God in flesh).</span></p></li></ul></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><h4 class="firn-headline firn-headline-4" id="todo-litany-to-systems"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>TODO Litany to Systems</span></span></h4><section><blockquote><p><strong><span>Small Group Activity:</span></strong><span> Find the dots</span></p><p><span>Join together with other workshop participants in small groups to
share your results from the previous activity, and cluster the themes
that you find there.</span></p></blockquote><ul><li><p><span>Thinking about the stories; finding the ‘dots’ in the litany, and start to connect them in the systems.</span></p></li></ul></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-5"><h5 class="firn-headline firn-headline-5" id="systems"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Systems</span></span></h5><section><blockquote><p><strong><span>Solo/Pair Activity:</span></strong><span> Advice from a Caterpillar</span></p><p><span>"'Who are you?' said the Caterpillar."</span></p><p><span>Reflect on your observations, and use your observations to describe
your own personal perspective.  You might comment on aspects of your
values, professional training, and life experiences that led you to
make these observations, as well as the direct circumstances (e.g.,
other actors you encountered) in your environment who contributed to
shaping your experience.</span></p><p><span>(E.g. if you worked for the police you’d see different things from
someone who works for the NHS, probably.)</span></p><p><span>To make use of the workshop environment, use a "think-pair" strategy:
after doing some reflection on your own, turn to your neighbour and
discuss what the two of you have come up with.</span></p></blockquote><ul><li><p><span>What systems/factors/actors bring about these observations and experiences?</span></p></li><li><p><span>Who do you think is involved in the </span><em><span>decisions</span></em><span> that shaped your environment?</span></p></li></ul></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-6"><h6 class="firn-headline firn-headline-6" id="todo-systems-to-worldview"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>TODO Systems to Worldview</span></span></h6><section><blockquote><p><strong><span>Small Group Activity:</span></strong><span> Map-making</span></p><p><span>Return to the small groups and bring together the themes you
identified earlier, and add in the new information from your
reflection.  Work together with this group to arrange the information
on a map.  Notice that since people have navigated different physical
locations, your ‘map’ is likely to be a somewhat abstract space.</span></p></blockquote><ul><li><p><span>How would you represent this information on a map?  How would you visualize it?  How would you explain it to others?</span></p></li><li><p><span>(E.g., </span><em><span>our</span></em><span> worldview is probably already summed up in the diagram that LV drew, showing the inputs, process, and outputs of the workshop.)</span></p></li><li><p><span>E.g., Hypothesis about Kennington, Oxfordshire: the older people perceive place as a village, younger people perceive it as a settlement on the outskirts of Oxford.  Older people might perceive what’s missing and also what’s new.</span></p></li></ul></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-7"><h6 class="firn-headline firn-headline-6" id="worldview"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Worldview</span></span></h6><section><blockquote><p><strong><span>Small Group Activity:</span></strong><span> Problem identification</span></p><p><span>Using your map and working together with the small group, talk about
the problems you’ve noticed.  How does the map represent stressful or
concerning experiences?  What are some alternative histories or
alternative futures that would describe how the circumstances would
have changed.</span></p></blockquote><ul><li><p><span>What do you want to have happened?  What would you like to have happen in the future?</span></p></li></ul></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-8"><h6 class="firn-headline firn-headline-6" id="todo-worldview-to-myths"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>TODO Worldview to Myths</span></span></h6><section><blockquote><p><strong><span>Full Group Activity:</span></strong><span> Dimension analysis</span></p><p><span>Working together with the full group, arrange the maps you created
across a set of dimensions.  Two dimensions would be traditional
(creating a 2-by-2 grid with "best" in the upper right, "worst" in the
lower left) — but feel free to use as many as you wish.</span></p></blockquote><ul><li><p><span>From maps to myths.</span></p></li></ul></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-9"><h6 class="firn-headline firn-headline-6" id="myths"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Myths</span></span></h6><section><blockquote><p><strong><span>Full Group Activity:</span></strong><span> Scenarios</span></p><p><span>Working together with the full group, use the dimensions you created
in the previous activities (together with the maps and stories) to
describe several scenarios for the future.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>The output of each preceeding layers feed into the next one; when we
get to the Myths later, we need to personalize what was uncovered in
the Worldview layer, and prepare to return to the other layers in the
later phases of the workshop.</span></p><p><span>\medskip</span></p></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-10"><h6 class="firn-headline firn-headline-6" id="todo-myths-to-next-phases-of-the-workshop"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>TODO Myths to next phases of the workshop</span></span></h6><section><p><span>The goal is to run something akin to an inception.  Our preliminary
postulate is that, if people could change stuff on their own, they
would have done it before.  Our goal is to challenge their views, so
that they leave the workshop with a modified understanding of how the
world works (i.e. the myths that drive them).</span></p></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-11"><h6 class="firn-headline firn-headline-6" id="after-the-workshop"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>After the workshop</span></span></h6><section><p><span>By running this process in a lot of different spaces, we’ll learn
something; different people are likely to have have different maps and
myths.</span></p></section></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><hr /><div class="back"><p>Back to blog: <a href="https://exp2exp.github.io/erg">Exp2Exp: ERG notes</a></p></div></article></main></body><script>anchors.options = {
