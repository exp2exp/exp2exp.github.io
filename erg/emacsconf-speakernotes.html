I’m Raymond Puzio, I learned about Emacs back around high school and have been using it since then; I’ve been active in Emacs meetups, and I use it in research in science.
I’m Joe Corneli, I also started using Emacs in high school, now I use it for a lot more things than I did.  My research background is in mathematics and online communities.</span></p></blockquote></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="prelude"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>PRELUDE</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#1m">1m</a></span></span></h3><section><blockquote><p><span>The four of us met at EmacsConf 2020 with a common interest in Emacs
and research.  We’ve met almost every week since then, because we
wanted to keep the conversation going.  In this short talk, we share
information about the methods we use, making a case for other people
getting together and creating their own small research communities
similar to ours.</span></p><p><span>Here’s the outline of our talk: We’ll tell you technologies we use in
our meetings, and demo a part of our meeting, as well as explain the
processes that we use when conducting our meetings to have a deeper
understanding of what we’re talking about.  Finally, we’ll talk about
what came out of these meetings: we wrote a paper for PLoP 2021 and we
designed a workshop using the knowledge we created together.  This has
brought us to the importance of collaboration, and we have some
lessons about how you can create a research community similar to ours.</span></p></blockquote></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="background-+-technology"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>BACKGROUND + TECHNOLOGY</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#2m">2m</a></span></span></h3><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><h4 class="firn-headline firn-headline-4" id="emacs-research-group"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Emacs Research Group</span></span></h4><section><blockquote><p><span>You’ll have noticed that we all have different research backgrounds.
We think that transdisciplinarity is important for solving big
problems.  If you’re going to have people from different research
backgrounds talking to each other, they need some scaffolding in both
tools and methods to help them have good conversations.  Of course, as
Emacs users, we wanted Emacs at the centre of that.  Being in a
meeting taking real-time notes with Emacs realises a dream that some
of us have been entertaining (and experimenting with) for a while.
The package crdt.el by Qiantan Hong makes this easy.  We take notes on
our meetings using Org Mode.  Since we’ve seen this before in talks on
reproducible research, Leo’s the maintainer of Org Roam, it’s
particularly natural choice.  For one thing, it allows us to quickly
put our notes online using Git and the static site generator Firn.
Lastly, of course, we need a real-time meeting tool and for that
purpose we use BBB in our weekly sessions (in fact, the same server
used by EmacsConf, thanks again to Leo).  All of these tools are
free/libre/open source (though BBB has some intensive hardware
requirements).</span></p></blockquote></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="prerecorded-demo"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>PRERECORDED DEMO</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#2m">2m</a></span></span></h3><section><blockquote><p><span>Here’s a short prerecorded snippet from one of our recent meetings so

In
order to have this kind of conversation and still get things done, we
need a pretty rigorous structure in place at the bigger scale of the
meetings.  This involves both a timetable for the meetings, and some
review and planning processes [!].</span></p></blockquote></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><h4 class="firn-headline firn-headline-4" id="timetable"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Timetable</span></span></h4><section><blockquote><p><span>Leo: The meetings generally follow a structure of informal checkins
followed by any announcements, at most two topics (with a break in the
middle) and a review of what happened at the end, followed by a quick
checkout.  The whole thing takes two hours in total.  We meet weekly,
and the consistency is really important for how the group works.</span></p></blockquote></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-5"><h5 class="firn-headline firn-headline-5" id="project-action-review"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Project Action Review</span></span></h5><section><blockquote><p><span>Joe: At the end of every meeting we ask and answer a series of
questions adapted from the ‘After Action Review’ developed by the US
Army in their training programs, and used in some business contexts.
The adaptation here came out of the Peeragogy project which I’ve been
involved with since 2012, and it’s designed to be less hierarchical
than the AAR.  By writing down and sharing these reviews we create a
resource for further peer learning later down the line.</span></p></blockquote><pre class="language-"><code class="language-">EXAMPLE

four-layer framework to better understand the underlying themes that
surface in the reviews, and develop the deeper motivations for our
ongoing work together.  This helps us get a big-picture sense of where
we are going that we keep up to date at a slower pace than the weekly
meetings.  This also helps us tie our work into a broader context and
gives us some hope that over time we can contribute to solving big
problems.  Transdisciplinarity is important, but we need to know how
what we’re doing fits into the bigger context.</span></p></blockquote><pre class="language-"><code class="language-">EXAMPLE

we don’t just think about what happened in the previous meetings, but we
also take the longer view, thinking about things like structuring a
community of collaborators, or building platforms for scientific research.
We want to think about how what we’ve been doing fits into broader
historical patterns and trends.  In the past, the pattern is a historical
pattern; in the present we contextualise what we’ve learned; towards the
future we augment our big-picture analysis with next steps.  This helps us
keep things on track.  (We keep our patterns collated with a developing
design pattern language from the Peeragogy project.)</span></p></blockquote><pre class="language-"><code class="language-">EXAMPLE

adapt methods from elite training, future studies, and collaborative
design, and apply them to address significant problems in social
networks. We focus on three such methods: we use Action Reviews to
implement social perception, Causal Layered Analysis to implement
social cognition, and Design Pattern Languages to implement social
action. To illustrate the methods in combination, we first develop a
case study, showing how we applied them to bootstrap a distributed
cross-disciplinary research seminar. We then use Causal Layered
Analysis to explore the ways in which the design pattern discourse has
been evolving. Building on these analyses, we elaborate several
scenarios for the future use of design patterns in large-scale
distributed collaboration. We conclude that the combination of methods
is robust to uncertainty -- by supporting adaptations as circumstances
change -- and that they can help people coming from different
backgrounds work together. In particular, we show how methods drawn
from other domains enrich and are enriched by design patterns; we
believe the analysis will be of interest to all of the communities
whose methods we draw upon.
