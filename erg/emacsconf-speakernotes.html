going to get started with something a bit lighter.  This is a talk
about something I’m involved with; you might know me from Org Roam and
Emacsconf... although I only feature briefly in the recording.]</span></p></blockquote></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="prelude"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>PRELUDE</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#1m">1m</a></span></span></h3><section><blockquote><p><span>I’m Raymond Puzio, I first learned about Emacs and Lisp at an
enrichment program for high school students.  When I studied physics at
the university, I used Emacs and TeX to write mathematical documents.
Later on, I became active in Lisp and Emacs user groups where, among
other things, I learned about org mode for reproducible research.
Nowadays, I am working on synthesizing Emacs and other programs into
an end-to-end platform for scientific research and collaboration.</span></p><p><span>I’m Joe Corneli, I also started using Emacs in high school in a course
on C programming and now I’m technically a computer scientist.  My
research background is in mathematics and online communities.</span></p><p><span>Hi, I’m Noorah Alhasan, I’m a member of the ERG group, and a PhD
student at UT Austin studying climate policy.</span></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><span>Noorah: The four of us met at EmacsConf 2020, last year, with a common
interest in Emacs and research.  We’ve met almost every week since
then, because we wanted to keep the conversation going.  In this short
talk, we share information about the methods we use.</span></p><p><span>Here’s the outline of our talk: We’ll tell you about the technologies
we use, and show a short demo video from one of the meetings.  We’ll
then focus on the time and content structuring methods we use in our
live sessions.  Finally, we’ll talk about what came out of all this
work.  We wrote a paper for the Pattern Languages of Programs
conference and we designed a workshop using the knowledge we created
together.  VERY PRACTICALLY, THIS HAS IMPROVED THE QUALITY OUR OWN
COLLABORATION, AND WE HAVE SOME LESSONS ABOUT HOW YOU CAN CREATE A
RESEARCH COMMUNITY SIMILAR TO OURS.</span></p></blockquote></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="background-+-technology"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>BACKGROUND + TECHNOLOGY</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#2m">2m</a></span></span></h3><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><h4 class="firn-headline firn-headline-4" id="emacs-research-group"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Emacs Research Group</span></span></h4><section><blockquote><p><span>Joe: You’ll have noticed that we all have different research
backgrounds, and we think that transdisciplinarity is important for
solving big problems.  If you’re going to have people from different
research backgrounds talking to each other, they need some scaffolding
in both tools and methods to help them have good conversations.  Of
course, as Emacs users, we wanted Emacs at the centre of that.  Being
in a meeting taking real-time notes with Emacs realises a dream that
some of us have been entertaining (and experimenting with) for a
while.  The package crdt.el by Qiantan Hong makes this easy.  We take
notes on our meetings using Org Mode.  Since we’ve seen this before in
talks on reproducible research; and also since Leo is the maintainer
of Org Roam, it’s particularly natural choice.  For one thing, it
allows us to quickly put our notes online using Git and the static
site generator Firn.  Lastly, of course, we need a real-time meeting
tool and for that purpose we use BBB in our weekly sessions (in fact,
the same server used by EmacsConf, thanks again to Leo).  All of these
tools are free/libre/open source (though BBB has some intensive
hardware requirements).</span></p></blockquote></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="prerecorded-demo"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>PRERECORDED DEMO</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#2m">2m</a></span></span></h3><section><blockquote><p><span>Joe: And here’s a short prerecorded snippet from one of our recent
meetings so that you can get a sense of how they go.</span></p></blockquote></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="process"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>PROCESS</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#2m">2m</a></span></span></h3><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><h4 class="firn-headline firn-headline-4" id="organising-metaphor"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Organising metaphor</span></span></h4><section><blockquote><p><span>Noorah: In the demo you saw a very improvised free-flowing
conversation.  In order to have this kind of conversation and still
get things done, we need a pretty rigorous structure in place at the
bigger scale of the meetings.  This involves both a timetable for the
meetings, and some review and planning processes [!].</span></p></blockquote></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><h4 class="firn-headline firn-headline-4" id="timetable"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Timetable</span></span></h4><section><blockquote><p><span>Joe: The meetings generally follow a structure of informal checkins
followed by any announcements, at most two topics (with a break in the
middle) and a review of what happened at the end, followed by a quick
checkout.  The whole thing takes two hours in total.  We meet weekly,
and the consistency is really important for how the group works.</span></p></blockquote></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-5"><h5 class="firn-headline firn-headline-5" id="project-action-review"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Project Action Review</span></span></h5><section><blockquote><p><span>Ray: At the end of every meeting we ask and answer a series of
questions adapted from the ‘After Action Review’ developed by the US
Army in their training programs, and used in some business contexts.
The adaptation here came out of the Peeragogy project which some of us have been
involved with since 2012, and it’s designed to be less hierarchical
than the Army’s review.  By writing down and sharing these reviews we create a
resource for further peer learning later down the line.</span></p></blockquote></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-5"><h5 class="firn-headline firn-headline-5" id="causal-layered-analysis"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Causal Layered Analysis</span></span></h5><section><blockquote><p><span>Joe: Every six weeks or so, we analyse the transcripts of the action
reviews using a four-layer framework from future studies to better
understand the underlying themes that surfaced in the reviews, and
develop the deeper motivations for our ongoing work together.  This
helps us get a big-picture sense of where we are going that we keep up
to date at a slower pace than the weekly meetings.  This also helps us
tie our work into a broader context and gives us some hope that over
time we can contribute to solving big problems.</span></p></blockquote></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-5"><h5 class="firn-headline firn-headline-5" id="design-patterns-and-next-steps"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Design Patterns and Next steps</span></span></h5><section><blockquote><p><span>Ray: Going back to solving larger problems: when we carry out the
analysis we don’t just think about what happened in the previous
meetings, but we also take the longer view, thinking about things like
structuring a community of collaborators, or building platforms for
scientific research.  We want to think about how what we’ve been doing
fits into broader historical patterns and trends.  In the past, the
pattern is a historical pattern; in the present we contextualise what
we’ve learned as a design pattern; towards the future we augment our
big-picture analysis with next steps.  This helps us keep things on
track.</span></p></blockquote></section></div></div></div></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="projects"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>PROJECTS</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#2m">2m</a></span></span></h1><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="summary"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Summary</span></span></h2><section><blockquote><p><span>Noorah: We have been working on several projects: A paper for the
pattern conference, mentioned earlier, a workshop, and a user study
And we’ll say a little more about these.</span></p></blockquote></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="patterns-of-patterns-(plop-2021)"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Patterns of Patterns (PLoP 2021)</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#LITANY">LITANY</a></span></span></h2><section><blockquote><p><span>Noorah: We coauthored a paper that touches on all of the topics we
mentioned earlier, and presented it at the leading conference on
Design Patterns for programs and programming.  One of the case studies
in the paper sums up the way we work in ERG.  The paper puts ERG in
context with other peer learning communities, and we aim describe our
way of working in a way that others would find accessible and
potentially useful.</span></p></blockquote></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="placard-workshop-roles"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>PLACARD Workshop roles</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#SYSTEM">SYSTEM</a></span></span></h2><section><blockquote><p><span>Noorah: We are also developing an interactive workshop based on the
ideas in in the paper, which we piloted at the PLoP conference.  Our
intent with the workshop was to build a method for rapid problem
solving, which could, at least in principle, expand beyond the
workshop setting to distributed networks.  The workshop involves
made-up roles—like a kaiju communicator who helps understand problems
as they arise.  We also realised that it has given us a lot of wealth
for thinking about the roles we take on in our weekly meetings.</span></p></blockquote></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="initial-user-studies"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Initial user studies</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#WORLDVIEW">WORLDVIEW</a></span></span></h2><section><blockquote><p><span>Ray: Free software may be lacking on ‘user’ aspects: people often
program to scratch their own itches, and assume others will do the
same. To deal with this, we did severa things.</span></p><p><span>We looked at user experience and development together to see how the
process went jointly and where the gaps are.  We compared Emacs with
other platforms, not just at the technical level but also at the user
experience level.  We had guest sessions, where we’ve started
gathering user stories.  Building on these conversations we would like
to do more research in all these topics and eventually be able to say
something like:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>‘If you are someone who does X, these are the packages that would
  work for you’</span></p></li></ul></blockquote></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="broader-context"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Broader context</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#MYTH">MYTH</a></span></span></h2><section><blockquote><p><span>Joe: Putting these ideas into practice, our PLoP paper and the plans
it contains become a </span><em><span>template</span></em><span> for some of the other things we want to
work on as we go forward.  If we imagine things in 2–3 years, what
would it actually take to realise that vision in the paper?</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Thinking about the future: this is one of the main reasons why we
  want to share these ideas and invite other people into this way of
  working: there’s no way we can achieve everything in our vision all
  by ourselves.</span></p></li><li><p><span>What we’ve been focusing on in Season Zero of ERG is methods that
  other people can use for organizing their own research groups.</span></p></li></ul></blockquote></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="conclusion"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>CONCLUSION</span></span></h1><section><blockquote><p><span>Joe: We decided to share this talk so that folks can learn from our
