on/in/with Emacs back in October 2020. We’ve met almost every week
since then, and interviewed some interesting and varied guests. We
have a clearer idea of what what we want to talk about at the next
EmacsConf, and how we can be of service to researchers and Emacs
users. We have been using a workflow that helps us carefully review
progress, diagnose issues, and manage our energy.  We’re understanding
how research is done by doing it, and keeping careful track of the
process. If a session doesn’t go as well as hoped, we think about why
(especially Leo as chair). The idea is that you know what the bomb is, so you can at
least hope to defuse it later. We try to adapt gracefully to
circumstances as they evolve, without being reactive because we know
we will be back again next week and the week after, etc.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="12-system"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>1.2 System</span></span></h3><section><p><span>If we tackle big enough projects, it will bring with it the need for
collaboration. (And we need to respect these other parties.) We like
to create tangible deliverables (e.g., journal articles). However,
“If we knew what the outcome was it wouldn’t be research” — therefore,
we’re focusing initially on research methods and design documents. So
far many of the stakeholders have to do with free software, open
communities, peer learning: all of this is part of a broader
initiative. All of them will need some degree of systematised
activities and documents. This is what we’re experimenting with; in
principle, we can provide meta-management workflows.  In the way we work together we make sure
to take account of emotions, not just a time table. We’ve been
experimenting with futures methods that help us use the future
intelligently: neither trying to do everything ‘live’, nor
overburdening the future with a bunch of plans that can’t be
realised.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="13-worldview"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>1.3 Worldview</span></span></h3><section><p><span>We have looked at RStudio and Roam Research as models of (some of) the
kinds of things we think Emacs can eventually improve upon. Actually
getting there requires thinking about the specificity of what Emacs
can do. At least nominally, it is a system for editing. For example,
currently we can edit a wiki using Org Roam and Git. What about
editing distributed knowledge graphs? This would allow people to
reference ongoing research processes. Or we could go further and
contribute to the development of a new distributed read-write Web!
Alongside such software products could come various services, such as
a matchmaking service for academics, or a set of 24/7 virtual
conferences. To make such thing really useful, we need to get
coherence out of various long-running, diverse, and hetereogeneous
thought processes: and make sure we help people address real
problems. We can start small, working with the members of ERG and
their networks. We’re certainly not the only people who are struggling
with some unexpected commitments.  Successful adaptation requires the
articulation of an entire system. Thinking again about Emacs: its
current documentation is certainly useful, but it leaves many gaps,
some of which are filled in other ways (e.g., by mailing lists). As we
work we are paying attention to the growth not only of knowledge, but
also of capability. For this, we often rely on our feelings (getting
it, not getting it, accomplishing something or not, etc.).</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="14-myth"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>1.4 Myth</span></span></h3><section><p><span>In our concrete methods, we have aligned ourselves with the ‘long-term
perspective’. This includes both retrospective and prospective
thinking. For example, the things that were timely 7 years ago might
not be now; in many cases the relevance of a given innovation goes down over
time. That said, Emacs has an evolutionary character that has
allowed it to keep up with the times — apparently becoming
increasingly relevant and useful ever since Steele and Stallman
started to systematise Editor MACroS for the Text Editor and Corrector
(TECO) program. Not only has the technology evolved, but so has the
social setting in which this work is done. After nearly a year of
working together, we’re now prepared to argue that other people should
consider getting together to create their own communities similar to
ours! The concepts underlying the free software movement were based on
“communal sharing” of source code: now we’re working on developing and
sharing other methods as well. Just like free software has
legitimately expanded the range of what’s humanly possible, so too may
further efforts expand frontier of possibility. As above, this takes
careful articulation, and a willingness to do truly original research
(without relying on fixed assumptions about what research is meant to
be, or where we will find value).</span></p></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="emacsconf:-storyboarding"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>EmacsConf: Storyboarding</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#35m">35m</a></span></span></h2><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="meta"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Meta</span></span></h3><section><ul><li><p><span>We might want to think about the priorities of some of those points; it’s probably more important to talk about crdt.el than talking about the fact that we had the summer off.</span></p></li><li><p><span>JC: What about the local stake-holders?

Emacs in 2 hours a week for a year

This is our story:

The four of us met at EmacsConf 2020, and joined together around a
common interest in Emacs and research.  Since then, we have convened as
the Emacs Research Group for weekly meetings.  During these meetings, we
took notes collaboratively, using a ‘conflict-free replicated data type’
package (crdt.el); at the end of each session, we debriefed using a
template that we call a Project Action Review (PAR).  As as a
meta-review of our sessions, every six weeks we prepared a Causal
Layered Analysis (CLA), which gave us a different perspective on what we
had done.  We reflected further on our experiences and methods, linking
our CLA to plans and design patterns.  As a formal research output, we
contributed a write-up of these matters to a joint paper which we
presented at the Pattern Languages of Programs Conference (PLoP 2021).
The paper included an interactive workshop, in which we explored roles
in real-time problem solving and collaboration.

In our short talk we share information about these methods, making a
case for other people getting together and creating their own small
research communities similar to ours.

We think that transdisciplinarity is important for solving big
problems.  If you’re going to have people from different research
backgrounds talking to each other, they need some scaffolding in both
tools and methods to help them have good conversations.  Of course, as
Emacs users, we wanted Emacs at the centre of that.  Being in a
meeting taking real-time notes with Emacs realises a dream that some
of us have been entertaining (and experimenting with) for a while.
The package crdt.el by Qiantan Hong makes this easy.  We take notes on
our meetings using Org Mode.  Since we’ve seen this before in talks on
reproducible research, Leo’s the maintainer of Org Roam, it’s
particularly natural choice.  For one thing, it allows us to quickly
put our notes online using Git and the static site generator Firn.
Lastly, of course, we need a real-time meeting tool and for that
purpose we use BBB in our weekly sessions (in fact, the same server
used by EmacsConf, thanks again to Leo).  All of these tools are
free/libre/open source (though BBB has some intensive hardware
requirements).</span></p></blockquote></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-5"><h5 class="firn-headline firn-headline-5" id="done-notes-for-the-above"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>DONE Notes for the above</span></span></h5><section><ul><li><p><span>JC: Transdisciplinarity is going to be important for solving big problems</span></p><ul><li><p><span>JC: It’s not a matter of talking at conferences, but </span><strong><span>solving problems</span></strong></p></li><li><p><span>RP: We could mention a problem that we’re trying to solve with Emacs here to be practical about it.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>JC: crdt.el could be part of it?

questions adapted from the ‘After Action Review’ developed by the US
Army in their training programs, and used in some business contexts.
The adaptation here came out of the Peeragogy project which I’ve been
involved with since 2012, and it’s designed to be less hierarchical
than the AAR.  By writing down and sharing these reviews we create a
resource for further peer learning later down the line.</span></p></blockquote><pre class="language-"><code class="language-">EXAMPLE

four-layer framework to better understand the underlying themes that
surface in the reviews, and develop the deeper motivations for our
ongoing work together.  This helps us get a big-picture sense of where
we are going that we keep up to date at a slower pace than the weekly
meetings.  This also helps us tie our work into a broader context and
gives us some hope that over time we can contribute to solving big
problems.  Transdisciplinarity is important, but we need to know how
what we’re doing fits into the bigger context.</span></p></blockquote><pre class="language-"><code class="language-">EXAMPLE

we don’t just think about what happened in the previous meetings, but we
also take the longer view, thinking about things like structuring a
community of collaborators, or building platforms for scientific research.
We want to think about how what we’ve been doing fits into broader
historical patterns and trends.  In the past, the pattern is a historical
pattern; in the present we contextualise what we’ve learned; towards the
future we augment our big-picture analysis with next steps.  This helps us
keep things on track.  (We keep our patterns collated with a developing
design pattern language from the Peeragogy project.)</span></p></blockquote><pre class="language-"><code class="language-">EXAMPLE

adapt methods from elite training, future studies, and collaborative
design, and apply them to address significant problems in social
networks. We focus on three such methods: we use Action Reviews to
implement social perception, Causal Layered Analysis to implement
social cognition, and Design Pattern Languages to implement social
action. To illustrate the methods in combination, we first develop a
case study, showing how we applied them to bootstrap a distributed
cross-disciplinary research seminar. We then use Causal Layered
Analysis to explore the ways in which the design pattern discourse has
been evolving. Building on these analyses, we elaborate several
scenarios for the future use of design patterns in large-scale
distributed collaboration. We conclude that the combination of methods
is robust to uncertainty -- by supporting adaptations as circumstances
change -- and that they can help people coming from different
backgrounds work together. In particular, we show how methods drawn
from other domains enrich and are enriched by design patterns; we
believe the analysis will be of interest to all of the communities
whose methods we draw upon.
