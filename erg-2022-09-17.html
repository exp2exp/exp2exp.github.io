understand their common ground, and discover the right tools to
continue working together.  We’ll give an overview of the discoveries
we’ve made in a two recent pilots related to public space and future
studies.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="&lt;20-minutes:-(brief-descriptionoutline)"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span><20 minutes: (brief description/outline)</span></span></h3><section><p><em><span>[All of the above and...]</span></em></p><p><span>We reflect on how </span><strong><span>technology</span></strong><span> — including further evolution of Emacs —
could help make collaboration </span><strong><span>methods</span></strong><span> even more effective at
addressing bigger problems, with bigger groups.  Note-taking with CRDT
helps us practice ‘active listening’ in our meetings.  Thinking about
other affordances of Emacs, we’re excited about how </span><strong><span>data analysis</span></strong><span> and
more structured interaction patterns could aide in going back over our
old thoughts and getting more out of the time we spend together.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="&lt;40-minutes:-(brief-descriptionoutline)"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span><40 minutes: (brief description/outline)</span></span></h3><section><p><em><span>[All of the above and...]</span></em></p><p><span>Lastly, we’ll bring these ideas together to introduce our </span><strong><span>plans for a
day-long workshop specifically for Emacs</span></strong><span> users and developers, to work
together to imagine the future of Emacs.  Of course, in this setting,
participants will again have a considerable technical common ground,
and the community already has a long history of collaboration.
Nevertheless, Emacs presents both challenges (especially for new
users) and interesting opportunities.  We hope to get your feedback on
the kind of workshop you’d be excited to attend, before we run it (in
about a month!).</span></p></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="feedback-&amp;-outtakes"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Feedback & outtakes</span></span></h2><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="ft:-feedback-1"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>FT: Feedback 1</span></span></h3><section><ul><li><p><span>A shell, system, that can hold all kinds of workshops & collaborations.</span></p></li><li><p><span>We apply it to a workshop w/ a topic from people who want to run the workshop.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>It’s more about the method (for the workshop)...</span></p></li><li><p><span>We could do it for any topic (= content)</span></p></li></ul></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="lv:-feedback-2"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>LV: Feedback 2</span></span></h3><section><ul><li><p><span>Group of maintainers to support each other, making it less lonesome</span></p></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="&quot;5-10-minutes&quot;-outtakes--extra-info?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>"5-10 minutes" outtakes / extra info?</span></span></h3><section><p><span>For us, </span><strong><span>Emacs provides a common ground</span></strong><span>, but not everyone uses it.</span></p><p><span>Indeed, we could run our meetings with other tools or conduct them in

tools will make our meetings work even better!  But so far, our way of
running the meetings has far outweighed any flaws of the tools, and
has allowed us to find a joyful way of working together.  We wondered:
could we share this way of working with others?</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="&quot;20-minutes&quot;--outtakes--extra-info?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>"20 minutes"  outtakes / extra info?</span></span></h3><section><p><span>We’ll dive the workshop design, and how it relates to the structure of

creativity, but in our meetings we can lean on a shared history.  In
the workshop, we aim to scaffold brand-new collaboration patterns.
More specifically, we use a process to develop collaboration through
creative interaction with peers, with the bare minimum of top-down
teaching.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="na:-convert-questions-into-statements,-that-will-make-it-stronger"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>NA: </span><u><span>Convert questions into statements, that will make it stronger.</span></u></span></h3></div></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="break"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>BREAK</span></span></h1></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="agenda-(part-2)---catch-up-on-life-stuff-+-work-on-the-&quot;making-of&quot;"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Agenda (Part 2) - Catch up on life stuff + work on the "making of"</span></span></h1><section><ul><li><p><span>Chaos</span></p></li><li><p><span>Kindness</span></p><ul><li><p><span>LV: I abhor interruptions!
