class="firn-headline-text"><span>Demo</span></span></h3><section><p><span>We start with the open source Powershell Core, zoomed in so we can see what’s going on.</span></p><p><span>Uses things like </span><code>Get-Location</code><span> but it also supports commands like bash </span><code>ls</code><span>.</span></p><p><span>From here, I would say “I am going to do some analysis” so I’ll make some text</span></p><p><span>Now I go and write some text.  For me that’s how I’d write, then I’d
do </span><code>:w</code><span> to write, </span><code>:q!</code><span> and I see the thing.</span></p><p><span>In the clojurebits directory.</span></p><p><span>So I could try </span><code>vim helloworld.clj</code></p><p><span>if I want to </span><code>(println "hello there world")</code></p><p><span>To run it I run </span><code>clojure .\hello_world.clj</code><span> and I get the printout.</span></p><p><span>So, I can write files, run files — this is nice but it’s not so nice
as doing everything inside vim.  Within Vim I can open a terminal.</span></p><p><span>You’ve got a terminal now in split screen, where you can in principle
run commands.  Or, you could have two terminals side by side.</span></p><p><span>Within Clojure I can </span><code>(load-file "hello_world.clj")</code><span>.</span></p><p><span>I usually use RStudio IDE, but Clojure doesn’t have RStudio.</span></p><p><span>Emacs has CIDER which is specifically for Clojure, but we could start
with a more vanilla environment.</span></p><p><span>Running </span><code>emacs -nw</code><span> — you now have about 10 billion key bindings, </span><code>C-x
C-f</code><span> to find a file.  I can find it.  How do I then.</span></p><p><code>CMD shell</code><span> doesn’t know</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="intervention-from-leo"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Intervention from Leo</span></span></h3><section><p><span>We’re not doing a great job of demoing.
