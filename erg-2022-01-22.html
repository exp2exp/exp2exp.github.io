Ray, Cameron(?); others looking at "how to use Emacs within their other research projects";</span></p></li><li><p><span>Could we find ways to share information about topics like biology and policy where we have a mechanism to go deep (in separate groups) and still stay in communication (with the wrap).</span></p></li><li><p><span>This is reminiscent of the </span><code>#intention</code><span> mechanism we’re using on Hyperreal Discord</span></p></li><li><p><span>A lot of the stuff happening around Emacs have been location-based so far (Emacs </span><em><span>Paris</span></em><span>, Emacs

counter to our scaling-down effort</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>JC:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Perhaps it doesn’t matter what we do during those meetings; rather than muddling them all in a soup.  This particular "ERG" could focus on HCI things, but other groups could be focusing on Scientific computing, Development issues, and so on.</span></p></li></ul></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><h4 class="firn-headline firn-headline-4" id="concerns"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Concerns</span></span></h4><section><ul><li><p><span>NA: How to circumvent the frustration of bringing atomic ideas into the main meeting, which is to be focused on the main HCI thing?  A possible solution is, that we’d work asyncronously on our separate ideas, by utilizing *Org Roam*; e.g., RP+JC could meet to talk about ob-servant, bio-physics... the notes could appear in the same wiki; if we have it documented then we don’t have to tell everything on Saturday; I can just check the Org Roam, and it might say at high level everything I need to know</span></p><ul><li><p><span>RP: Yes, similar to the </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://peeragogy.org/wrap" target="_blank">Wrap</a><span> pattern.  Other domains can also serve as test cases for HCI research on Emacs, so we’re not just looking at the real-time meeting stuff in the discussion here</span></p></li><li><p><span>JC: So far, it sounds like the joint intention is to find a way to not struggle with the same bandwidth.  I think it’s fair to discuss “Here’s what I’ve tried to do with Emacs and didn’t manage”.  In particular, in this time slot we won’t be aiming at paper-writing, which might clunk up the process; but we could potentially talk about other paper-writing activities that take place in other groups.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Collaboration within Emacs</span></strong><span> as the theme, what’s working, what could be improved</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>We do have some other groups going, and, e.g., we could help foster the other groups; maybe some overlaps</span></p></li></ul></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="back-to-soft-goals"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Back to soft goals</span></span></h3><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><h4 class="firn-headline firn-headline-4" id="what’s-the-culture-that-we-need-in-order-to-have-a-thriving-community?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>What’s the culture that we need in order to have a thriving community?</span></span></h4><section><ul><li><p><span>LV: We’ve been thinking in terms of input and output; should a group have an output?  But at the end of last year we steered more towards "what does it mean from human-to-human to be meeting regularly, and what tools assist this collaboration?"</span></p><ul><li><p><span>This is more ‘lay’ and less ‘academic’; but it’s also quite practical and close to our </span><code>in/on/with</code><span> setting, with its practicality</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>NA: The soft goal of EmacsConf can be to talk about the fact that we’re hanging out, using Emacs, talking about it; that’s enough for me!  Others could benefit from this</span></p></li><li><p><span>RP: If others shared information on this level we could learn from them.</span></p></li><li><p><span>JC: Imogen asked me “how did you learn to program?”, which I did out of a desire to circumvent typing-induced wrist-RSI.  This might be just a nice little anecdote, but I was impressed in how supportive the Emacs community was and about the boundless generosity of thos</span></p><ul><li><p><span>JC: What would be the generalisation of this experience?  How are people using Emacs?  What are their pain-points?  What are </span><em><span>our</span></em><span> pain-points?</span></p></li><li><p><span>JC: Maybe LV’s workflow could help here?</span></p></li></ul></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><h4 class="firn-headline firn-headline-4" id="trying-to-conclude-on-soft-goals"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Trying to conclude on soft goals</span></span></h4><section><ul><li><p><span>EmacsConf </span><strong><span>2021</span></strong><span> : How we formed as a group?</span></p><ul><li><p><span>EmacsConf </span><strong><span>2022</span></strong><span> : XXX</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Then: Process to address XXX</span></p></li><li><p><span>Ongoing reflection on "what’s working and what’s not working"; e.g, "I’m enjoying watching Joe typing the notes right now; once we’re done, I’ll save it and push it to the repo."  And CRDT share buffer, I love it!  Let’s keep building on these things!</span></p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><span>JC: Looking back at last year, one </span><strong><span>lesson learned</span></strong><span> was that the CLA seemed great to everyone, but it feels like some members had not appropriated the tool.  They liked the process and the conclusions, but weren’t taking part in the gathering process.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>So, do we maintain the previous way of working? Change it? Throw out the CLA?</span></p></li><li><p><span>JC: All this stuff about "how we work together" feels different from the way other groups work.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>LV: Other groups have meta aspects but we tend to have a very meta aspect.  Can we be </span><strong><span>leaner</span></strong><span> than we were last year?  Perhaps the time now is to constrict some the shutter so we can pin-point on something.  Can we apply concepts like "make meetings more meaningful" so that we can, e.g., show up to the meeting and already know what the meeting is about.</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>Choose some specific voices and do something specific with them</span></p></li><li><p><span>RP: Other transdisciplinary voices can be part of the broader group [JC: network?]; how do we interact with them?</span></p></li><li><p><span>LV: Let’s not let this component overtake the picture-making (e.g., let’s maintain relations with peeragogy, CRDT, and all this, but let’s not struggle with holding the ropes that connect us); who we are and what we’re doing is mostly defined in terms of a Venn intersection of Peeragogy, EmacsConf, Hyperreal, Emacs Packages... and we’re supposed to make out of this nebulous intersection what we’re trying to be.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Let’s try: stop thinking in terms of intersections or outputs, but soft goals, for us to grip around or focus on.</span></p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><span>NA: Common theme for Saturdays is "Emacs"</span></p></li><li><p><span>RP: Other things are also Emacs</span></p></li><li><p><span>JC: If we’re writing our EmacsConf talk, why not go back to what we did in October/November.  Perhaps we could reintroduce goals like that on a monthly basis so that, in the next 10 months, we can do something like 1 slide per month.  The point would be to come to the meeting knowing what the theme is; “what do we need to do?”.</span></p></li><li><p><span>NA: “Emacs & =$blank=” could be a monthly topic</span></p><ul><li><p><span>E.g., </span><code>yasnipet</code><span> template to fill out the org file.</span></p></li><li><p><span>"Emacs and templating"; something we could experiment with</span></p></li><li><p><span>"Emacs and asyncronous notetaking" - simple stuff that we do every week, and just document them, talk about them, do them every week</span></p></li><li><p><span>JC: That sounds good!  If that’s our worldview (that we want it to be fun, interactive, etc.), then we have no shortage of examples: Emacs & timetracking, etc.  We don’t have to plot it all in advance, and we can think in advance.</span></p></li><li><p><span>NA: If you’ve done something with Emacs, let’s learn about it; but let’s stay away from deep theoretical topics</span></p></li><li><p><span>Tech request: how could we look at the Org Roam and see what’s changed and what’s interesting over the last week or month?</span></p></li></ul></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><h4 class="firn-headline firn-headline-4" id="summary"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Summary</span></span></h4><section><ul><li><p><span>Have an objective for the month</span></p></li><li><p><span>Aim for EmacsConf</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Let’s not get to September and wonder "What do we talk about?"
