What is included within it, and what is not?</span></p><ul><li><p><span>This is stemming from the fact that we’re all doing different things, and we dump multiple things onto those meetings, which feeds into a feeling of </span><em><span>indirection</span></em><span>.</span></p></li><li><p><span>JC: One of the best things about the meetings this far was that the chair was coming with an agenda, impelling a sense of direction, albeit too-pluralised</span></p></li><li><p><span>[vs "our objective is to get to Paris and then to Reims"]</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>LV: There are "Why we meet" and "How we meet" questions.</span></p></li><li><p><span>"If I can’t meet the bar to meet the meeting..."</span></p></li><li><p><span>-JC: What is the </span><em><span>bar</span></em><span> to joining those meetings?  What are the </span><em><span>norms</span></em><span> (which seems to be an inherently Buddhist terminology/concept).</span></p><ul><li><p><span>“A nice norm from Peeragogy is that: ‘we’re going to come at this time, and you’re welcome to join!’”</span></p></li><li><p><span>In Peeragogy, we thought so much about norms, positing that they’re a net benefit.</span></p></li><li><p><span>"Any edit is an improvement or intends to be"</span></p></li><li><p><span>Norms in a practical sense that impacts what actually happens in our activities.</span></p></li><li><p><span>CD: Assuming that the edit is an improvement has been very helpful. Also, w/ confusion / conflict: there’s a peeragy podcast episode about critical conversations...</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>JC: If we’re trying to clear up everything from the different overlapping meetings, that adds </span><em><span>massively</span></em><span> to the level of confusion.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>JC: NA had made a nice definition for the PLACARD workshop, optimising the definition around “our meeting here and then </span><em><span>is</span></em><span> the workshop” (this is a start)</span></p></li><li><p><span>LV: if you’ve accumulated a lot of cruft, you could just clear the table and throw out the playbook... get it back... and see what is going on.  We could do something similar with ERG; because we have more history there would be a larger playbook.  We started a discussion WRT patterns... but... we may be getting a bit lost into conceptual aspects; norms as a frontier between how and why... but hereforth, discussing what the norms are.</span></p></li></ul></li></ul></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="norms"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Norms</span></span></h3><section><ul><li><p><span>NA: we use emacs, we all have this in common; it’s fun to do everything in Emacs even in these 2 hours.  This is part of the participation</span></p></li><li><p><span>JC: Second that; it’s quite funny to meet on Saturdays for this!  This is light, enjoyable work.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>LV: Not a Church of Emacs but...</span></p></li><li><p><span>RP: "Not a cult (tm)"</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>NA: Another is the art of collaboration, the art of different backgrounds coming in for a shared idea or project... this is a strong norm, we’re here to collaborate</span></p></li><li><p><span>LV: I was going to go back to what Joe was saying in terms of light, enjoyable work; light/work is somewhat in tension (labour vs work, toiling?); for me, exploring it is about "making progress that is vaguely professional" and "the mode of being that should not be taxing".  Work on its own is taxing; it’s something we have to do to sustain your existence, and you (may) damage yourself; light-work ... it’s trying to cut off the element of strife, we discussed since June/July.  Before that it was excitement only.  The Song of Innocence may have been lost, but it might be distilled into a Song of Experience that preserves everyone from generating strife for themselves and others.</span></p></li><li><p><span>RP: For me, having to do system admin, reset computer isn’t light work; I can’t do it on a quick timeline of a few weeks. Part of it is to do w/ the other things that have been piled up since June.</span></p></li><li><p><span>LV: As a member of the group, backlog could take 3 months, but what about the 10 minute version that would get ≈80% of the results?  What would actually solve the issue?  E.g. microphone patching would fit in given sufficient space; you have proficient people who can bring it down from weeks to days, or weeks to minutes with collaboration dedicating our mind to it.  It’s fine if it’s only one problem, we go on w/ our day, but if it starts piling up and can last months, then it seems mindboggling; we all have stuff to do but it is our own responsibility to make sure we have space for the meetings we do attend.  If you come from a position of strife you have to wonder was it a move forward?  Or backwards?  Or no step at all?</span></p><ul><li><p><span>I’m frustrated by apologies w/o follow-through that would allow collaboration to actually resolve the problem. You couldn’t dream of a better team of people to walk through the process of "collaborative work with Emacs": we are writing that playbook.  We are developing tools, designing </span><code>org-meetings.el</code><span> to make this for everyone.  Your inputs are valuable here, but can be undermined by not ironing out the kinks.</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>RP: The tech problems have pre-requisites. I would appreciate help if I can get it (like I appreciated help w/ email).</span></p></li><li><p><span>JC: Tech problems have prerequisites, and LV is a specialist on those issues, and could potentially help on this.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>JC: Restorative justice idea</span></p></li><li><p><span>LV: I can justify this if I can guarantee it won’t impact me negatively with regard to my emotions.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Think of it as a meta-process that is running in my mind.  If it is causing emotional damage I have to continually think "do I need to abort the situation"; I’m a little at the end of the rope. I’ll accept the apology for reactivity at the start and offer my own for sternness; but the history here is what makes this sternness accessible as my reaction. It felt to me that the only way.</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>Potential and concrete farewells; if this is the case.</span></p></li><li><p><span>LV: I was either reacting sternly or leaving the meeting; but if I am at this point as the past chair and someone taking the notes, it’s a red flag, and I would heavily encourage us to think about this and work on it as much as we can work on it.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>RP: To clarify:...</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>JC: I’d heard from LV and NA that the CLA had not been a tool that was appropriated by all.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>JC: It feels like this discussion is akin to CLA, but maybe going to its mere meta roots.</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>LV: This is essentializing CLA/PAR workflow "How are things going" and going back to the roots of what it’s supposed to be about.  No matter how unpleasant difficult conversations, it is more effective to have them.  Previously we did get value from CLA, but could have had 3-4 times as much serendipity w/ broader adoptation.</span></p></li><li><p><span>NA: If I imagine our Saturday meetings: "Light creative ‘work’."  We bring in our creativity, there’s no hard outcomes that we have to get right now, let’s come in relaxed, share our creative ideas, that will help us allow serendipity to happen.  If we come in with hard core tasks... sure we have an agenda to guide us...  can we come together on a consensus of how these</span></p></li><li><p><span>JC: What does it feel like to have a philosophy group?  Those Saturday sessions feel pretty close to a symposium.</span></p></li><li><p><span>JC: One way we could possibly define ERG (and we don’t have to) is that it’s a subgroup of Hyperreal...?</span></p><ul><li><p><span>But presently it doesn’t have such an institutional affiliation.</span></p></li><li><p><span>(NA: ... but clearly we still want to have fun with Emacs.)</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>Could relate to longer-term projects</span></p></li><li><p><span>What does it mean to be an Emacs group?</span></p></li><li><p><span>We could then mobilise research, not on "Emacs", but what is an "Emacs-Group"?</span></p><ul><li><p><span>This could bring forward the sociability</span></p></li><li><p><span>Maybe we should try to provide a recipe to people to achieve certain similar things in their week</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>JC: Since Charlie is a relative newcomer to Emacs it would be interesting to discuss later how that’s a limiting factor;</span></p><ul><li><p><span>LV: how can we encourage people to work in the meetings to have those social moments where they are sharing?  We do have outputs... how do we make sure that people who have a similar level of proficiency can achieve similar stuff?  There could be a study run based on these methods.  There could be more people interacting with Emacs, sharing the philosophy, in a way that’s visual, understandable, and that makes it obvious that the tools are instrumental to the philosophy... and how good they seem.</span></p></li></ul></li></ul></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="scheduling"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Scheduling</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#5m">5m</a></span></span></h2><section><ul><li><p><span>Next ERG meeting: </span><span class="firn-timestamp">2022/1/15</span><span> (4 weeks from now)</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Allows time to reflect, bring norms, expectations, and such)</span></p></li><li><p><span>This idea has universal acclaim</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>RP: Would be glad to keep in touch meanwhile depending on what’s convenient</span></p></li><li><p><span>LV: I will be consumating the break; I’ve been meeting-fatigued, and now feeling better at the pool but still need a break to be able to ask myself questions about meetings and think about them</span></p></li><li><p><span>JC: I could look into the technical stuff with RP, Charlie, or whoever would be willing; this could be folded into a peeragogy schedule</span></p></li><li><p><span>CD: Back to ERG, Noorah offered a long time ago to help with Emacs and I’ve procrastinated about a year on that offer; if I could be "optionally" available in January 15th.

This is trying to mobilise what Charlotte said about taxonomies, they can become a box from which you have to think outside.  The processes are adaptable...
