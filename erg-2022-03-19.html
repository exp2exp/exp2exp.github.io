Peer
learning, practical, in line with the actual model that they are
building...  Proposal w/ simple Alexander-type patterns are still very
much "this is how it should be done".  Whereas here we are talking
about patterns that are set within a network of patterns that describe
how they could be used by different people </span><em><span>3 different scenarios</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><span>A few different tools that can be used to explore it.</span></p><p><span>Proposed policies; existing governmental policies; E.g., local policy
"all food must be sourced from within 50 miles of this particular
borough"</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Maybe it's unsustainable to bring food in, or there are
  over-fractious politics at play.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>But where is the evidence coming from that allows you to articulate
the problem in this way.</span></p><p><span>Then you'd have multiple policies (e.g., food fridges, donations,
allotments, community farms).</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Then you start to demonstrate the process by which you organise your
  thoughts.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>Architects might then say: "We build a food hub at an allotment site
to allow people to exchange food from local gardens."</span></p><p><span>(What are the design solutions that will solve that problem.)</span></p><p><span>How different is this to how they would solve things normally?</span></p><p><span>Maybe it's not, but we might get some extra pixie dust out of looking
at how they solve things, looking at how people think about things
(e.g., food waste — cf. UWE </span><em><span>Food Network</span></em><span> and FoodTinder; how do you
redistribute food around the city: So, advertise your food, and you
can swipe left or right if you need the food for a given recipe).</span></p><p><span>— What information do you need to make this work?  E.g., what does a
dating site rely on?</span></p><p><span>— What’s modelling adding to that?  E.g., if we had a certain amount
of resource and certain amount of scarity, how to optimally ensure
that people are interacting in the right space?</span></p><p><span>"How far are you willing to go to get some...?"</span></p><p><span>This is something interesting to model.</span></p><p><span>Cf. Noorah’s story about the local </span><em><span>disaster-preparedness group in Texas</span></em></p><p><span>One of the UWE folks has a background in large-scale systems like
Amazon... "Let’s learn what people want before they know".  How can we
make the food system intelligent in this way?  Similar to disaster
planning... how can we </span><em><span>anticipate</span></em><span>?</span></p><p><span>Maybe using this keyword is a good way to get leverage?</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="todo-how-would-we-describe-patterns-in-3-5-slides?--action-item-for-erg"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>TODO How would we describe patterns in 3-5 slides?

Inference), systems will be evaluated in light of a problem faced and
its capacity for adaptive change/resilience in the face of that
problem.  Each problem-system will be described as a pattern, setting
out the evidence and hypothesis for resolution.  Each pattern is
itself evolving over time, shaped by new findings; contextual,
specific to the problem at hand, evidence-based and related to other
patterns; and communicable, both teaching and learning for users of
multiple disciplines.</span></p></blockquote><ul><li><p><span>Cf. The </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://conscious.is/15-commitments" target="_blank">15 Commitments</a><span> as a source for thinking about patterns!</span></p></li><li><p><span>Do we need the concept of "leadership"?
