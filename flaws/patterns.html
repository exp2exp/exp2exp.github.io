organisation and residents are responsible for existing public trees and
new ones, after which local government authorities take over caring for
them. Those first five years are vitally important if the trees, planted
and existing, are to be healthy and long-lived. During this time, the
community and development organisation can establish policies and
strategies for site trees, so that local government can continue with
the foundational tree management afterwards, including the on-going
appointment of a respected arboriculturalist.</span></p><p><span>Often people are afraid of big trees in public spaces or private gardens
because they may drop branches or fall on cars or houses in severe
storms. This can be addressed by </span><strong><span>consistent arboriculture care</span></strong><span> (for
instance visit the Arboriculture Australia website in resources
section). Trees can be encouraged to grow in particular shapes to remain
amenable to social commoning. There are various stages to caring for
trees so that branches do not fall, and trees remain healthy.</span></p><p><strong><span>First, trees need deep friable soil, air and water</span></strong><span>. For trees in open
space, start with the Keyline method of preparing planting areas (see
the KEYLINE pattern). This will ensure healthy soil and water for good
growth. Tree planting in streets and public space need adequate areas
and depth of soil (see the pattern SELECTING SHADE TREES FOR PUBLIC OPEN
SPACE)</span></p><p><strong><span>Second, check and manage trees for insect pests</span></strong><span> Providing the proper
cultural care in accordance with climate and needs of a tree species is
the best way to prevent insect infestations. Eucalyptus trees, for
instance, appreciate supplemental irrigation during prolonged dry spells
and experts at the University of California Integrated Pest Management
Program suggest watering eucalyptus plants once a month with a drip hose
until the top 12 inches of soil become moistened and performing
maintenance pruning when pests are waiting out the winter season, in
order to avoid attracting insects into freshly cut wood tissue (see
Kelsey [n.d.] in the references below).</span></p><p><strong><span>Third, prune and maintain branch and trunk health</span></strong><span> to keep structural
soundness to withstand storms and strong winds. This can include
reducing the weight of the canopy by selectively pruning the ends of the
branches.</span></p><p><strong><span>Cable and brace</span></strong><span> where branches need more support or have been damaged.
Cabling keeps tree branches from splitting at their junction. This
involves attaching various types of cables to stronger branches, the
trunk, the ground or other anchors. Cabling can also be used to support
unusually long limbs or reinforce weak-wooded species.</span></p><p><strong><span>Dynamic Cabling</span></strong><span> (or </span><strong><em><span>‘Cobra'</span></em></strong><span>) allows the limbs to sway, putting
less stress on trunk and branches. Thus, tree continues to produce</span><strong><span>reaction wood</span></strong><span> (special cells) in response to wind or other stresses.
Dynamic systems generally use synthetic ropes instead of cables, and
they usually wrap rubber around the branches being supported, rather
than relying on metal hardware that has been screwed into the tree.</span><strong><span>Cobra**system</span></strong><span> is a dynamic tree support system specially designed to
be flexible and shock-absorbing with different benefits:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Gentle to trees, self-adjusting to the diameter growth of tree,
  requires practically no tools, and incorporates a shock-absorbing
  unit;</span></p></li><li><p><span>Avoids defective growth, the ‘karate effect', abrasion and
  constriction, wounding;</span></p></li><li><p><span>Encourages trees to grow reaction wood.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>Cobra system components include cobra rope, anti-friction hose,
expansion insert, shock absorbers (Arbor Culture Pty Ltd, n.d.)</span></p><p><strong><span>Crown thinning and lifting</span></strong><span> allows more sunlight to pass and air to
flow through the canopy. This is done by removing some secondary
branches. Crown lifting raises the height of the crown and allows more
space underneath for lawns and gardens.</span></p><p><strong><span>Good Arboriculturalists can undertake these procedures and maintain
your trees with annual inspections.</span></strong></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="pattern-conditions"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Pattern Conditions</span></span></h3><section><p><strong><span>Enablers:</span></strong></p><ul><li><p><span>Undergrounding powerlines means trees can grow full mature form.

open canopy and open fencing, where the wind can pass through without
turbulence. Groves of trees, rather than rows, effectively channel
prevailing winds and achieve greatest density of canopy when species are
mixed.</span></p><p><span>**Canopy Density is increased when trees are crowded; crown branching

twice the volume of other branches. The branching is flatter and crown

Private trees have
personal meanings to the people who planted them. They are often planted

insect attacks (see the pattern CARING FOR TREES).</span></p><p><span>Often people are afraid of big trees in private gardens because they may
drop branches or fall on houses in severe storms. But trees are living
beings so selecting the tree(s) for a garden will depend on how much
space and deep soil is available. Site planning for private garden trees
also requires mapping the prevailing winds so that garden trees and
shrubs can channel cool breezes and screen winter winds. Also, where
garden tree(s) are placed will depend on their purpose; that is, whether
it is to shade the house and garden, provide privacy or to be a personal
garden feature. It is a good idea to therefore map garden areas that are
shaded in summer & are sunny in winter (see the pattern SITE PLANNING

commitment. With care, trees should be long-lived, healthy and provide
increasing shade to enable cool streets. The attention to good growing
conditions and on-going tree management that maintains shade-giving
canopies suggests that installing and caring for street trees should be
done in unison with urban water management. (See the patterns MANAGING
ON-SITE WATER & CARING FOR TREES).</span></p><p><strong><span>Growing conditions -- soils</span></strong></p><p><span>The designated area for street trees is restricted requiring site and
technical planning for adequate soil volume. Soil depth is important,
but more essential is the soil area for roots to spread and access
oxygen. Because of competing users in streets -- pedestrians, services,
vehicles -- the maximum area for lateral root growth can be achieved
through porous paving and grass from property boundaries to kerbs.</span></p><p><span>In paved plazas, the use of Structural Soil Systems (SSS) composed of a
two-part system of cellular modules for strength and structural support
(load bearing) and filler soil can enable tree growth. In this way,
structural stability is provided, plus interconnected voids for root
penetration, air and water movement.</span></p><p><strong><span>Growing conditions -- water</span></strong></p><p><span>Water-sensitive urban design can ensure that water reaches the roots of
the trees; this includes redirecting kerb water through spaced inlets
into the tree pits.</span></p><p><strong><span>Tree Selection</span></strong></p><ul><li><p><span>Ten criteria are relevant to street trees in urban environments:</span></p></li><li><p><span>Drought & Heat tolerance are increasingly important in UHI. Isolated
  trees can experience high heat and radiation loads in urban areas,
  increasing tree water stress; plant trees in groups to mitigate this.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Wind tolerance is relevant as urban trees have to withstand
  turbulence.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Tree longevity is reduced in urban environments.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Pollution tolerance: the effects of pollutants on trees can cause the
  tree to weaken and die. Most pollutants to trees are airborne,
  including oxidants, sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide; sunlight
  reacts with oxidants to form tree pollutants such as ozone.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Pathogen and pest susceptibility and manageability</span></p></li><li><p><span>Potential as allergens to humans and animals: of the 50,000 different
  kinds of trees, less than 100 have been shown to cause allergies; most
  allergies are specific to one type of tree or to the male cultivar of
  certain trees.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Shade cast (see the pattern SELECTING SHADE TREES)</span></p></li><li><p><span>Maintenance required; this is generally higher in a younger tree in
  order to attain the form needed to suit site constraints.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Tree litter: all trees will shed litter, leaves, bark, flowers or
  fruit at some time during a given growing season. Plane trees drop
  hard fruit which can be a pedestrian hazard.</span></p></li></ul><p><strong><span>Size Matters</span></strong></p><p><span>One strategically located large-stature tree more impact on conserving
energy and mitigating the urban heat island effect than a corresponding
quantity of smaller trees.

on-site storm water and runoff. It involves capturing and storing
stormwater, reducing water consumption and impact on local water
systems, and improving water quality. This is achieved using grassed or
landscaped swales, infiltration trenches and bio-retention systems,
gross pollutant traps, wetlands, sediment ponds, rainwater tanks for
storm water harvesting and as cooling devices, rain gardens, rooftop
greening and urban forests, porous pavements, aquifer recharge and
reuse.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rain gardens and bioswales</span></strong><span> are vegetated depressions located on
gradients. Their main function is the retention and infiltration of
stormwater. Acting as a filter for runoff from permeable surfaces, they
reduce pollutants which enter storm systems. They are a way to manage
bioretention areas by capturing and holding roof and road runoff but
will not maintain optimal drainage rates if soils become compacted, it
is therefore important to minimize foot traffic in this area, except
walking for maintenance. Regular applications of mulch maximize the
swale's ability to capture and break down contaminants. Rain garden
plantings should not be fertilized to prevent excess nutrients run-off.</span></p><p><span>*Structural soil*s are an engineered soil mix designed to allow three
functions: reduce pavement heaving and breakage; improve stormwater
infiltration; and improve tree growth. Structural soils can also
improve stormwater infiltration if covered with a porous paving material
(see Seattle Green Factor (2008 p.4) for more information). </span><strong><span>Stormwater
planters</span></strong><span> are containers designed to capture and either retain or
filtrate stormwater, based on their design. The amount and frequency of
water captured depends on storm events, so they should be populated with
a variety of plants adapted to both wet and dry conditions. Visually,
they can be striking landscape features providing a high functional
value.</span></p><p><span>Properly designed soil conditions are required to achieve stormwater
infiltration and increased plant growth. Deep soil is considered to be
that which is penetrating to base rock and water table. In planters,
soil depth should be a minimum of 600mm for shrubs and ground covers and
minimum of one metre for small trees.</span></p><p><span>*For improving water efficienc*y: rain sensors fitted to irrigation
systems can reduce water use; amalgamated planter beds will improve
efficiency of irrigation systems and mulch in garden beds reduces water
evaporation from soils.</span></p><p><strong><span>Permeable Paving</span></strong></p><p><span>Permeable paving allows sites to infiltrate stormwater in a way similar
to natural systems. Permeable pavements also restrict non-point source
pollution from entering surface water bodies, which helps keep creeks
and streams clean. Permeable pavements also contribute towards healthier
plantings because root systems are aerated. </span><strong><span>Permeable asphalt</span></strong><span> can be
used in some cases to replace traditional asphalt and allow for
infiltration of stormwater.</span></p><p><strong><span>Permeable concrete</span></strong><span> can be used in place of impervious concrete in many
non-driving situations. Its use in parking lots can help reduce the
amount of stormwater runoff and non-point source pollution.</span></p><p><span>Instead of pavers, the top layer can be either 150mm of Permeable
Asphalt or 150mm of Permeable Concrete, layered over 150mm of Open
Graded Aggregate, layered over Geotextile on the existing subgrade.</span></p><p><strong><span>Irrigation</span></strong></p><p><span>An integrated irrigation system must suit site the condition and the
requirements of the landscape. Efficient irrigation systems include:
rainwater storage tanks; appropriate species selection; soil depth and
soil quality to help minimise watering requirements and use of recycled
water. TANKLESS Underground Rainwater Storage is one means to collect
quality surface rainwater.</span></p><p><strong><span>Using Storm Water for Wetlands and Water Features</span></strong></p><p><span>On-site storm water management can ideally finish in wetlands and water
features.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Wetlands contribute important wildlife habitats and pleasant
  recreation areas.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Water features can add interest to paved public spaces. Their wide
  range of design styles and possible functional attributes can make
  them useful elements for cooling and aesthetics. Water features can
  also be engineered to clean & aerate water as well as recycle it.</span></p></li></ul><p><em><span>Sustainable Sydney 2030</span></em><span> targets include 10% of the City's water to

us in our cities. This pattern identifies (and provides a basis for
protocols for) infrastructures of care for cooling animals. These may be
deliberately designed permanent structures, such as Fiona Foley's Lotus
Line water sculpture at Redfern Park that invites multiple species;
architectural features of built environments that incidentally gather
water and/or provide shade; or more temporary solutions, such as bowls
of water put out for animals to drink. The provision of habitat is
another aspect of caring for animals in hot cities.</span></p><p><span>The need for infrastructures of care for cohabiting animals in the urban
common spaces is driven in part by human practices, such as water
diversion for irrigation.</span></p><p><span>Birds such as Ibises, which have migrated to cities because their
wetland habitats are disappearing, are perceived as urban interlopers --
alien and homeless. Cockatoos and Corellas have followed in their
tracks. Providing cooling infrastructures of care thus challenges

thermal comfort (Bloch, 2019). Shade is often, however, unevenly
distributed across the city, with tree canopy roughly proportional to
household wealth (Greater Sydney Commission, 2018). Shade structures are
needed to provide immediate cool / protection from the sun in
environments (such as linkages, nodes or even building interiors), where
trees are absent or immature.</span></p><p><span>While shade needs to be considered as an integral part of the planning
phase, it is identified here as a remedial pattern as there are many
existing hot environments, particularly away from coastal settlements,
where the addition of shade could vastly improve comfort, accessibility
and use.</span></p><p><span>Shade can be fixed or dynamic, natural or artificial, hot or cool,
permanent, temporary or worn. There are also many different qualities of
shade: type, density, distance from ground and colour matter. Jacobs et
al. (2018) at University of Technology Sydney for instance monitored
climate adapted bus shelters and found a significant decrease in
radiated heat from the ceiling of these structures, largely thanks to
the insulated roof panels. Bick (2018), found blue shade sails provided
the most effective shade in a study looking at the reduction of light
intensity under different coloured shade sails. Shade from sails,
however, was not found to be as effective as shade provided by awnings
or natural tree canopy.</span></p><p><span>Trees provide the coolest and most amenable shade, so preserving mature
trees wherever possible is a critical first step. Trees provide critical
cooling infrastructure in cities and removing them, even if they are
replaced, represents a loss potentially of decades of shade, amenity and
habitat. In Stuttgart, tree preservation orders protect city trees that
have reached a certain circumference from removal.</span></p><p><span>In areas of urban growth, however, shade needs to be factored back into
environments from which trees have already been removed and ‘meanwhile
shade' will be required.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="pattern-conditions"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Pattern Conditions</span></span></h3><section><p><strong><span>Enablers:</span></strong></p><ul><li><p><span>Strong community support for accessible shade.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Various cooling and liveability city plans (e.g. Penrith City Council,

flows downhill running off ridges and concentrating in valleys. The
basic site analysis for a keyline design includes identifying the ʻmain
ridgeʼ (the watershed divide), ʻprimary ridgesʼ (convex slopes radiating
off of the main ridge) and ʻprimary valleysʼ (concave basins receiving
runoff between primary ridges). The ʻkeypointʼ is where the slope
changes from convex to concave in shape and exists in valleys. It marks
the highest point in the landscape to hold water.</span></p><p><span>The contour passing through the keypoint is known as the ʻKeylineʼ.
Subsoil ploughing along the keyline decompacts degraded soils, improving
water infiltration, and distributing water more evenly. Subsoil plough
regime helps restore a soil's structure and water holding capacity. The
keyline subsoil rips create mini drainage channels diverting water
gently downhill and back out onto the ridges.</span></p><p><strong><span>This system uses the natural patterns of the landscape to catch and

satisfaction with (called post-occupancy evaluation) single or
multi-residential buildings </span><em><span>after</span></em><span> residents have moved in. This
pattern seeks to extend current post-occupancy studies to emphasise the
importance of learning from the experiences and practices of a community
of residents. Such ongoing learning is critically important if the aim
is to create liveable and sustainable places, as it could validate
goals, help identify and address emerging issues and opportunities, and
feed back into planning processes as a form of ‘continuous improvement'
and lifecycle planning.</span></p><p><span>Post-occupancy learning requires community engagement and outputs that
can form a durable record of a living place to inform learning over
time. This approach foregrounds and validates community expertise in the
lived context, which is under-represented in the literature about
liveability. Community stakeholders may initiate engagement around a
particular common concern, on a one-off or regular basis. Concerns might
be explored via regular resident walking meetings, workshops or social
‘living labs'. Mechanisms to ‘carry over' learning to improve the
planning and development process needs to be created, with precedents
existing in the form of collaborative governance arrangements (see
Report). Post-occupancy learning could facilitate enhanced openness and
trust and enable community-led innovation in planning and development
processes. It could also prime communities to explore the transition to
new practices, for example energy sharing, or new forms of water or
waste management. Citizen science projects recording local weather and
aspects of environmental change are a form of post-occupancy learning.
Retaining collected data in a local library (in addition to handing it
over to the investigating body [e.g. Australian Museum or Bureau of
Meteorology]) would enable future generations of residents to access
this data and facilitate intergenerational place-based learning. Adopt a
tree programs, where residents ‘adopt' a young local tree planted by
council and take responsibility for monitoring its health as it grows,
is another example. In this case, succession planning is important,
including mechanisms for intergenerational communication.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="pattern-conditions"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Pattern Conditions</span></span></h3><section><p><strong><span>Enablers:</span></strong></p><ul><li><p><span>Commitments to stakeholder engagement (e.g. Landcom's ‘Join-in

surrounding areas. This pattern is concerned with how patchworks of
places/spaces can provide more accessibility.</span></p><p><span>Patchwork for accessible coolth is a pattern of scattered spaces, forms
or services accessible to pedestrians; it is low-rise and integrated
within neighbourhoods, enabling a </span><em><span>spectrum</span></em><span> of fine differentiation.
This pattern suggests an alternative to continuous blocks of
development, or enclosed shopping centres.</span></p><p><span>Examples of built form and space types that could be patchworked
include:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Patchwork green in a city</span></p></li><li><p><span>Patchwork of social corners</span></p></li><li><p><span>Cooling refuges</span></p></li><li><p><span>Aged care</span></p></li><li><p><span>Pocket parks</span></p></li><li><p><span>Water play</span></p></li><li><p><span>Shops</span></p></li></ul><p><span>The accessibility of these places/spaces relates to the way people move
through them comfortably and how they know where they are going.
Patchwork analyses look at the fine grain, working closely with the
diverse ways people use urban space. Three ways of considering
patchworks (permeability & legibility; movement and responsive
environments) are offered here.</span></p><p><strong><span>Accessibility equals permeability & legibility</span></strong></p><p><strong><em><span>Permeability</span></em></strong><span> is both physical and visual in the way it allows people
to pass through; it entails both private and public interfaces and
provides variety in the choice of movement. </span><strong><em><span>Legibility</span></em></strong><span> exists where
the places/spaces have understandable forms such as edges, nodes, paths,
districts and landmarks (see Lynch 1960).</span></p><p><strong><span>Movement through patchwork</span></strong><span> involves a kind of serial vision, whereby
elements of an environment -- buildings, trees, nature, water -- can be
interwoven in such a way that causes anticipation to occur (see
Cullen 1961)*.* We experience places in sequence, as the existing view
and the emerging view simultaneously. Examples of these spaces are;</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Enclaves, enclosure;</span></p></li><li><p><span>Focal points, precincts; </span><em><span>hereness</span></em><span> and /thereness/;</span></p></li><li><p><span>Silhouette, incident;</span></p></li><li><p><span>Undulation, fluctuation;</span></p></li><li><p><span>Recession, anticipation, mystery.</span></p></li></ul><p><strong><span>Responsive Environments</span></strong><span> provide users with a democratic setting,
enriched by the degree of choice available (see Bentley et al 1985).

Dry
misting has been used extensively in public open space in Keyaki, Japan
and now in Toronto, Canada. Misting installations can also provide
attractive, interesting features into public spaces including
renovations of public parks, helping to increase their use. In some
instances, municipal authorities can commission misting devices and
misting fans as permanent or temporary art installations, which help to
generate higher footfall for local restaurants and retail businesses
(Roe, n.d.)</span></p><p><span>Although seemingly a misnomer, ‘dry mist' is formed when water is pushed
through a fine aperture at high pressure; the mist is so fine it
evaporates, feeling dry, and lowers the temperature by up to 30°F.
Misting fans are energy and water efficient, readily available and
easily installed. Depending on the types and placement of plants,
misting systems can double as watering systems, keeping plants lush and
green.</span></p><p><strong><span>Misting Pumps</span></strong></p><p><span>The most expensive part of the system is the high-pressure pump because
fine water droplets required for quick evaporation cannot be achieved by
low water pressure. Solar panels can supply the energy needed.</span></p><p><span>When installed and used properly, mist cooling systems can reduce
temperatures by as much as 30°F depending on the efficiency of the
misting system, relative humidity, and outdoor temperature. Evaporative
cooling is remarkably energy andwaterefficient.</span></p><p><span>*Misting devices cannot use stored on-site wate*r. The misting nozzle
requires mains water in order to ensure there is no particulate matter
to block it. There are also public health considerations if stored tank

evenings, when the heat of the day starts to dissipate from the public
domain and when it becomes cooler outside than in the home. Well-known
examples of night-time commons include night markets, festivals and
outdoor film screenings, all of which tend to be concentrated in urban
centres. As our summers get longer and hotter, the principle of the
night-time commons needs to be adopted more widely in an overall
strategy of rethinking how we use our local environments.</span></p><p><span>This pattern explores night-time commoning as a cooling strategy. An
important infrastructure that can be activated as night-time commons are
public parks and swimming pools. These environments are already cool
commons, but they tend to close in the evenings, precisely at the time
when they could best serve the community by providing a venue for
socialising, swimming, dining or other community gatherings on a hot
night.</span></p><p><span>Place-appropriate and engaging lighting is an important element in an
overall cultural shift toward night-time commoning. It is an attractor
for alternative park uses, to create ambience and promote safe
wayfinding and play. An example is the </span><em><span>Gates of Light</span></em><span> art
installation at Macarthur Heights, a park designed for stargazing. In
addition to lighting, the activation of night-time commons are most
successful when they provide signage, other communications and
activation events to legitimise use and raise awareness amongst the
local community of the opportunities to use these spaces at night. This
is important as unlike in Australia's regional neighbours, night-time
commoning is unusual in Australia. This is where examples such as night
markets, dance and exercise, or community cookouts, can provide
inspiration for activating parks at night.</span></p><p><span>Kevin Lynch's urban design principles cited in Dufner et al.'s (nd)
night lighting study, focus on how people move through and experience

space earmarked for future development, can provide opportunities for
site activation which reduces urban heat island effect, through greening
activities or through providing public access to private cool spaces.
Examples include pop-up uses such as shops or markets that use cool
materials or urban gardens. Existing car parks or vacant lots can
provide a platform for improved local cooling, with interventions
reducing the amount of impermeable low albedo hardscape.</span></p><p><strong><span>Citizens as urban co-producers</span></strong></p><p><span>Precedents for occupying urban spaces with temporary projects include
the Paris-based Atelier d'Architecture Autogeree. Their “ECOboxes”
(pictured) are installed in different neighbourhoods as temporary
platforms for participatory gardening and a mix of other social and
cultural activities. Activities include workshops, talks, screenings,
preparing and sharing meals. Another example is R-Urban, which is a
network of closed local ecologies where participants only consume what
is produced. Temporary urban gardening can encourage local capacity
building and encourage new forms of collaborative governance. For
example, in Brisbane, a community negotiated the right to develop a yam
plantation (pictured) on unused land for a three-year period, agreeing
to cover all costs including relevant insurances. The whole community
was involved in the preparation, cultivation and harvesting of the crop
which was then distributed among the community and to charity groups.
When the land was needed by the governing institution, a new plantation
was created temporarily elsewhere (Armstrong, 2016, p. 72).</span></p><p><span>The measure of success for this pattern includes reducing the ambient
and surface temperature of unused land by increasing the quantum of

elsewhere, has allocated a portion of available street parking to car
share programs in order to ensure equitable access. Car share programs

can then discern where to locate devices to provide shade and clean air,
dehumidifiers to reduce moisture, fountains to lower ambient
temperatures and even ultrasonic speaker systems to drive away
mosquitos. These will make up a pattern of devices for the benefit and
comfort of the users of the park. They will reinforce areas that are
already made comfortable by reducing the heat and humidity through means
such as specific plants and trees chosen for their ability to shade
according to their canopy, or water fountains and atomisers to cool the
air.</span></p><p><span>According to the number of devices in a given area, the spaces are more
or less enjoyable, more or less comfortable. Such climatic devices can
be versions of park furniture such as benches, fountains, or sculptures.
Their role will be either as dehumidifiers, or as devices that cool
surfaces from underground pipes or that decrease the intensity of light
or create shade. In planning for the park, buildings can be located in
the most uncomfortable areas whereas recreational and leisure activities
can be situated in the most comfortable microclimates; that is, where
heat and the relative humidity level will be at a minimum. The lowest
lying parts of the park are likely to collect rainwater, and so generate
higher air humidity. This is where the dehumidifying devices should be
placed. Keeping in mind the relationship of the park to its topography
and the water that is collected, </span><strong><span>keyline</span></strong><span> sub-ploughing can be used to
slow down rainwater and enable it to infiltrate as closely as possible

Deciduous trees for instance will form a shady canopy during summer and
also provide shelter from hot winds, and then let the sun through in
winter (ABC 2009). Trees take time to mature into a size that can afford
shade and coolth, however, and they need to be protected to mature.
Furthermore, mature trees can die back or die altogether, thus other
trees need to be on their way towards maturity to take their place. It
is therefore imperative that senescent trees, that is, trees of advanced
old age or trees in decline, that are more susceptible to disease,
insect infestation and decay, are responsibly managed in urban streets
and parks and that succession tree planting is planned for (City of Ryde
2016, pp. 24-26). This particularly requires the development of
expertise relating to:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Monitoring tree senescence patterns.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Staggering plantings over time.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Communicating clearly to park users the plans for staggered plantings,
  and the transformative processes currently taking place.</span></p></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="pattern-conditions"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Pattern Conditions</span></span></h3><section><p><strong><span>Enablers</span></strong></p><ul><li><p><span>Some Local Government Authorities are coming to realise that unplanned
  work to remove and replace individual trees on an ad-hoc basis is
  overly expensive and that a better solution is to develop a Tree
  Master Plan for parks and precincts, together with a tree inventory
  and community consultation programme (with calls for volunteering).</span></p></li></ul><p><strong><span>Constraints</span></strong></p><ul><li><p><span>Long term plans are difficult to envision, and changes can happen too
  slowly to be discerned sufficiently to inspire respect. Original plans
  might be lost over time if there are not activities that ensure
  intergenerational communication.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Trees may not grow as planned for. Extreme weather events can disrupt
