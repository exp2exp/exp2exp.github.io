Thinking about </span><em><span>the research process in general</span></em><span>.  I’ve come to this
collection of tools having filtered through a wide variety of options.
But the whole while I’ve been focused on research itself, not the
specific toolset.</span></p><p><span>So, I’d be motivated if we agree the prioritisation is ‘what does it
mean to do things like take notes & how can we do it in ways that help
us realise our interests?’.</span></p><p><span>I like to ask questions I don’t know the answer to.  I plan to engage
in this, but sometimes it feels like a waste of time.  You can</span><em><span>characaturise</span></em><span> taking notes: transcribing the world’s knowledge at a
snail’s pace!  You’ll never cover a useful fraction!</span></p><p><span>But what we’re doing is trying to augment our memory.  It slows us
down in reading, but likelihood that we’d remember is low.</span></p><p><span>So, there’s some co-optimisation... what we write down & what we
choose to ignore... evolves over the lifetime of anyone (and any
researcher in particular).</span></p><p><span>At the same time I believe in combining these philosophical things w/
very down-to-earth things.</span></p><p><span>What we functionally have is, Joe taking a note in a place where we
don’t all have access.  We </span><strong><span>could</span></strong><span> immediately solve this by opening a
Google Doc. This is why people don’t use these tools.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>RSP: Just transcribing doesn’t work well; usually the purpose of notes is to make a roadmap.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Literary example: Borges’s map vs an actual </span><strong><span>roadmap</span></strong><span> for the knowledge you have</span></p></li></ul></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><h4 class="firn-headline firn-headline-4" id="lv:-there’s-a-fundamental-aspect-of-ethics"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>LV: There’s a fundamental aspect of ethics</span></span></h4><section><ul><li><p><span>What we have here is free software, that allowed us to do research
