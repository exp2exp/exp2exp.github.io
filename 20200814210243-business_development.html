We
might do things that appear unrelated what we say at </span><strong><span>Why not what</span></strong><span> to
serve customer needs in the mean time.  However, if we do, we should
either come up with some reasoning about how this helps us address the
purpose, or revise our statement of purpose to reflect the current
reality.  This presumably isn’t hard to do, e.g., we could say “once
we have a successful business we will pour </span><em><span>x%</span></em><span> into research,” but in
any case we should clarify this.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="roughly-b2c"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Roughly B2C</span></span></h1><section><ul><li><p><span>Launch some version of the Emacs Hyper Notebook as a cloud service.
