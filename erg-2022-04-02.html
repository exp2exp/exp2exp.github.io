On one such late night excursion I stumbled upon this self-help book.  You get the usual stories... but the thing I liked is that those patterns are </span><em><span>meant to facilitate communication</span></em><span> and the life/health of the team.  It could be seen as a ‘self-help book for businesses’ that comes up with patterns and presents them in a way that could be useful for us to mimic.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>It’s efficient at presenting a model (they use the concept of a ‘Line’ and being ‘above or below the line’)</span></p><ul><li><p><span>So we could ask: what does it mean for the pattern to be deployed?

And I don’t feel we’re communicating well about the work we’re going to be doing; maybe partly because we missed a week.

How would this serve the workshop?</span></p></section></div></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="break"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>BREAK</span></span></h1></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="agenda-(part-2)---exploring-‘scenario-exploration’"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Agenda (Part 2) - Exploring ‘scenario exploration’</span></span></h1><section><ul><li><p><span>NA: Recap 3 points:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Feeling you’re not using your energy efficiently for the goal of financial sustainability</span></p></li><li><p><span>This flows into/from how we didn’t communicate well, we did some tip-toeing</span></p></li><li><p><span>And the project, e.g., when we talked about Ray’s involvement it seemed he wanted things to be go-go-go and we wanted to do something more laid back (what we’re doing here isn’t something that we have to accomplish, we can enjoy our 90 minutes together, and if we get something out of it great; in any case we enjoy each other’s company)</span></p></li></ul></li></ul><p><span>Plus:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Bringing in a wild card (e.g., Imo’s input): someone who doesn’t know anything about what we’re doing with the workshop.

The only thing I know is that I’m in a bad place right now. I’m overly critical with everything I say, and on edge. When I try to think about what to say I feel a sense of pressure.  Previously talking about the ‘15 Commitments’ I realised that it’s not helping it directly, and there is obvious stuff I could do that would help directly!  There’s a sense of tragedy about seeing people succeed at getting jobs...</span></p></li><li><p><span>I feel disconnected from most everything that I had in my life (ERG, Emacs, the job search, family, friends either online or in person): this brings a sense of isolation.  Any position where I put myself in the public and feel I failed... it makes me feel I’m making the wrong decisions.  This isn’t great for listening, contributing, or being up-beat.</span></p></li><li><p><span>NA: I definitely felt it when it doesn’t feel good hearing about others successes.

And I’m beyond burn-out on talking about it.  The one thing I need to do is work without the regular application of stress; but the stress permeates everything!  And I don’t find many places to find joy.  So the only thing I can do is seek down-time.  I wish I could make it sound happy!  But the last couple weeks have been rough.  Joe was helping but ERG seems like the only weekly thing; this is the weekly check-point.  For the last two months I’ve been showing up, thinking I want to be more to the point, but I’ve been having less to say.</span></p></li><li><p><span>NA: Even driving around at 1 AM in infusing some joy into your life.</span></p></li></ul></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="par"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>PAR</span></span></h1><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="1-establish-what-is-happening:-what-and-how-are-we-learning?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>1.
