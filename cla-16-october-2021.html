on/in/with Emacs</span></strong><span> back in October 2020.  We’ve met almost every week
since then, and interviewed some interesting and varied guests.  We
have a clearer idea of what what we want to talk about at the next
EmacsConf, and how we can be of service to researchers and Emacs
users.  We have been using a workflow that helps us carefully review
progress, diagnose issues, and manage our energy.  We’re understanding
how research is done by doing it, and keeping careful track of the
process.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>If a session doesn’t go as well as hoped, we think about why (esp. Leo as chair).

kinds of things we think Emacs can eventually improve upon.
‘Practice’ and ‘method’ keep coming up in our discussions as,
respectively, ‘more bottom up’ and ‘more top down’ ways of actualising
things.  Concretely, we’ve been studying our own processes and looking
for the tools and settings that are the most conducive to the work we
want to do.  For example, instead of having a single Org Roam
directory shared via Git, what if we had ways of managing sharing of
notes across ‘graphs’?  Collaboration is familiar to all kinds of
teams across all sectors.  Even authors working alone may have need to
‘virtually collaborate with themselves’ — and of course to share their
work with others when it’s ready.  If we all had our slipboxes online,
we could reference between them.  This would generalise </span><strong><span>ORCiD</span></strong><span>, and
people to reference processes that are undergoing evolution.  Maybe a
service like this would turn into a ‘Tinder for academics’ — helping
to match people based on their interests (or similar people in
different fields).  So, what’s the price point?  Instead of paying
money to go to conferences, now we can spontaneously make conferences
and workshops.  As a guess, $750.0 per user per year might be a fair
price — for those who can afford to pay it — if the service helps
people to do better research and saves a bunch of travel.  We could
also set up a pricing model proportional to each country’s carbon
emissions or something like that.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Getting some coherence out of our long-running and somewhat diverse and somewhat hetereogeneous thought process; this would be even more so the more stakeholders we involve</span></p></li><li><p><span>What scale does something need to be at to accomplish a certain goal?</span></p></li><li><p><span>This seems related to the long-range view; the further you look into the future the more the impetus to assess the scale becomes important.</span></p></li><li><p><span>E.g., PLoP took way more time than we anticipated.</span></p></li><li><p><span>If over-work due to under-estimating</span></p></li><li><p><span>There’s a spatial scale like how much work can we actually do sustainably (with how many people)</span></p></li><li><p><span>Making a difference might need more hands</span></p></li><li><p><span>The recovery is still in progress but hasn’t been stuck</span></p></li><li><p><span>We have fewer things to prepare, but we have tried to infuse our reflections into our way of working (between PLoP and EmacsConf)</span></p></li><li><p><span>How to return to some level of chill/flow/...?</span></p></li><li><p><span>Especially given that we are doing many other things, some of which we do in common and some which we don’t.

perspective</a><span>’.  This includes both retrospective and prospective
thinking.  For example, the things that were timely 7 years ago might
not be so timely now; in many cases the relevance of a given
innovation goes down over time.  However, Emacs has an evolutionary
character that has allowed it to keep up with the times — becoming
more relevant and useful ever since Steele and Stallman started to
systematise </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://www.oreilly.com/openbook/freedom/ch06.html" target="_blank">Editor MACroS</a><span> for the Text Editor and Corrector (TECO)
program.  Not only has the technology evolved, but so has the social
setting in which this work is done.  Whereas the concepts underlying
the free software movement were based on “</span><a class="firn-external" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-paper.html" target="_blank">communal sharing</a><span>” of source
code, with due reflection these methods extend much more broadly, and
allow us to synthesise new relationships within broader semiotic
commons.  Emacs can become a system for addressing any ‘existential’
problem.  This does not yet push us beyond what’s humanly possible,
but may expand the frontier of possibility.</span></p></blockquote></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="back-survey-related-work"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>BACK Survey related work</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#breakdown">breakdown</a></span></span></h3></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="back-assess-what-we’re-learning"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>BACK Assess what we’re learning</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#breakdown">breakdown</a></span></span></h3></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="back-figure-out-the-gender-balance-stuff"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>BACK Figure out the gender balance stuff</span></span></h3></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="data"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Data</span></span></h3><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><h4 class="firn-headline firn-headline-4" id="supporting-data-from-cla-5"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Supporting data from CLA 5</span></span></h4><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-5"><h5 class="firn-headline firn-headline-5" id="maybe-this-is-also-about-encoding-patterns-—-your-brain-is-fitted-to-see-patterns-in-the-world-and-put-concepts-behind-them-when-you-regress-from-this-point-and-assimilate-it-‘groking’-you’re-after-the-click!"><span class="firn-headline-text"><a class="firn-internal" href="https://exp2exp.github.io/erg-2021-06-19#maybe-this-is-also-about-encoding-patterns-—-your-brain-is-fitted-to-see-patterns-in-the-world-and-put-concepts-behind-them-when-you-regress-from-this-point-and-assimilate-it-‘groking’-you’re-after-the-click!">Maybe this is also about /encoding patterns/ — your brain is fitted to see patterns in the world and put concepts behind them.
