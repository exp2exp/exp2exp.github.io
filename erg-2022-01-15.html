The first thing we need to worry about with regard to a future, is to have feedback (which works!); in the spirit of lightness we shouldn’t outlaw feedback.  If we think something isn’t going the way we think it should be going, we should be voicing that.  And I like the group/therapy idea, or something that’s not just about problem-resolution.  We also want input-output, research, and delivery.  Perhaps the time would be now to consider the idea of outputs (both with light-creative work and healing that happens by sharing the way we’re working and what we’re doing in our individual endeavours).</span></p><ul><li><p><span>NA: Not everything needs to be resolved (agree)</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>NA: And still working within Emacs; maybe our mission could be to create systems or packages; "ways we can use Emacs to work collaboratively"</span></p></li><li><p><span>JC: [Will have stuff to answer after the break.]</span></p></li><li><p><span>JC: The trouble/pain we were feeling is a form of feedback, and ignoring it would have been at our own peril.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Intensity: this is a good thing to look at.

This was kind of kickstarted by presentation(s) we gave at EmacsConf</span></p><ul><li><p><span>JC: Another elephant in the room: is writing paper something that we should strive towards?</span></p></li><li><p><span>NA: Maybe a website of or notes?</span></p><ul><li><p><span>NA: Could use Org Roam to design the website and how things link to each other?</span></p></li><li><p><span>JC: Could this be linked to the proposal with Abby?</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Right now, we have a heartbeat (i.e. weekly meetings), but we haven’t proved if it were a good thing yet?</span></p></li><li><p><span>What would be the next increment over the heartbeat?  Some degree of "validation", perhaps!</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>NA: We could use our ERG Saturday meetings to experiment with those ideas, which would work into presenting it at EmacsConf.</span></p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><span>NA: Moving away from papers as a way to communicate with the public; I don’t care about communicating with academics anymore</span></p><ul><li><p><span>JC: Hence book-writing!  If you have to write 2–3 papers to academic to validate the idea, it detracts more than it helps.</span></p></li><li><p><span>NA: And it doesn’t necessarily have to be a published physical book, it can be something more interactive</span></p></li><li><p><span>JC: Could we go back to RP, suggest him to come check in with us on a monthly basis?</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>How to bring an audience? (Or a public?)</span></p><ul><li><p><span>JC: If we look like at our the presentations</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>LV: We will have EmacsConf, that public!  Do we need a panopticon for checking on immediate progress?  Well, if we log on a website, people can check it if they really want to (having been recruited from EmacsConf etc)</span></p></li><li><p><span>LV: We do have interested parties that we gathered from previous EmacsConf, who could be invited.  "Thinking about why we are meeting today" and simplifying; knowing we can work together, having 60% of the tools.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Open to novelty with other members, and don’t want to start dealing again with problems from last year</span></p><ul><li><p><span>JC: Perhaps we should think in it in terms of network: we’re doing this stuff here and now, us three, but people interested by what we’re doing would only be one or two hops away from hearing about what we’re doing.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Variant of the leader/member/observer ontology we talked about.</span></p></li><li><p><span>There’d still be "members", and we’d want to make all the people active in the way they can provide.  If people want to share things that they discovered, good!  If others want to share such things with us, great, they can share things with us.</span></p></li><li><p><span>So, this gets back to NA’s ideas about individual contributions; maybe Ray’s been sharing notes to this effect (and without stress)</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>NA: The goal is to discuss ideas on how to utilise Emacs for the work that we do, and I like the soft goal of EmacsConf that keeps us a bit focus</span></p></li><li><p><span>JC: If Emacs itself remains the focus of those sessions, then we’re good to go with EmacsConf or any other venue that talks about Emacs.</span></p></li><li><p><span>LV: We’ve been striving for simplicity, even with some long points also tied to this purpose.  We’re highlighting one of the problems we had before.  Some people came to the meetings because they enjoyed our company and energy, and, yes, it’s energising!  But we did lose focus of what we’re trying to do.  And based on these things we ended up committing to PLoP and thinking about how we work as a group, not about Emacs.  So, the objective of "just nailing the EmacsConf next year" could be centralising.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>That’s for ERG; more broadly we haven’t been meeting for coffee chats or workshops over the holiday.  If people were coming to ERG b/c it was giving them energy, or just to share their expectations of the week.  I’d say: I’m looking forward to modifying ERG to the above purpose; perhaps we should also be looking forward to other moments (e.g., 1-to-1 conversations or efforts on technology); can we use the time slots that we were using before for "actual work" more for some therapy aspects.  Let’s try to think in terms of therapy + generosity in the other times.</span></p></li></ul></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="open-forum"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Open forum</span></span></h2><section><p><span>Meta:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>This section would be nice to cover, but only if time allows us to.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Simplicity</span></p></li><li><p><span>Context of UWE work (≈£10K to budget in detail and then spend down)</span></p></li><li><p><span>Share information with open source work</span></p></li><li><p><span>LV: Wondering how to place "something": the commse lot of things latel I’ve been equipping myself to jump.  And now is the time to mobilise this great stuff, regardless of interview-prep.  I’ve been in stasis, which people often associate with depression and powerlessness.  I’ve been preparing a bunch of soft skills and asides.  There’s an unquenchable fire to do stuff!  To mobilise the same amount of regularity and performance that I’ve been able to mobilise in sports back into programming.  I’m not starved for projects (e.g., fixing things in emacs or getting a job in programming).  As a result I’d like to have some focus on my fortés!  E.g. technical aspects of the meetings, design features we would like to have in Emacs.  Timers, TODO-moving, all that.  Bringing distance, designing stuff together.  So I’d appreciate it if these moments can also bring material that I can work on, and I’d like this to be the individual contribution that I bring to the Saturday meetings.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>NA: Yes, part of this is about thinking about solutions that make our meetings better.  We’re prototyping ideas on Saturdays.  Nothing crazy.  Nothing too serious, let’s have fun creating.</span></p></li><li><p><span>LV: Yes, there’s the idea of casual progression; but I also want the goal to be great.  A great suite for meetings inside Emacs.  Casual rhythm of daily or weekly work is fine.</span></p></li><li><p><span>NA: Would an org mode suite for meetings be a reasonable goal to present?</span></p></li><li><p><span>LV: If last year was the year of collective work, I was spending more time in meetings, I’d like more time in solo experiences but also to connect it to the collective work wagon.  Not necessarily more meetings, but more about the "non-stress" dimensions (e.g., before Saturday); I don’t want to have to report on bullshit work for example.  I want to be able to do solo work that’s meaningful for ERG or other endeavours.  If we want to have other sessions about, say, slides.  We won’t do it on Saturdays; but with an ambiance that’s more stressful.</span></p></li></ul></li></ul><p><span>Points:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Try to get org-tag-realign (not actual name) working for NA.</span></p></li></ul></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="par"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>PAR</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#10m">10m</a></span></span></h1><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="1-review-the-intention:-what-did-we-expect-to-learn-or-make-together?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>1.
