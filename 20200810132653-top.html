advanced AI systems.  We expect that our stance on AI will not
necessarily be a popular one.  But this is an important “minor” strand
of AI research dating back to Alan Turing:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>"As time goes on the [computer] itself will take over the functions
both of [programmers] and of [users]…The [programmers] are liable to
get replaced because as soon as any technique becomes at all
stereotyped it becomes possible to devise a system of instruction
tables which will enable the electronic computer to do it for
itself. It may happen however that the [programmers] will refuse to do
this. They may be unwilling to let their jobs be stolen from them in
this way. In that case they would surround the whole of their work
with mystery and make excuses, couched in well chosen gibberish,
whenever any dangerous suggestions were made." -- Alan Turing, 1947.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>On average, advanced AI would bring in new ways of working, and would
facilitate broad access to high-quality training.  This agenda could
serve to focus the mind of technical workers, but not many are
pursuing it presently.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="motivation:-technical-experiments-become-easier"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Motivation: Technical experiments become easier</span></span></h1><section><p><span>Even in the present time, without relying on any speculative AI
futures to magically appear, we can benefit from pursuing the agenda
above.  Accordingly, we are doing some applied work with existing
software that will give us a set of further tools and levers to work
with.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="representative-prior-work"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Representative Prior Work</span></span></h1><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="planetmath"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>PlanetMath</span></span></h2><section><p><a class="firn-external" href="https://planetmath.org/" target="_blank">PlanetMath</a><span> users created a reasonably large informal mathematical

in between ‘games’ and ‘storytelling’ in its complexity.  We proposed
to build computational models of informal mathematical reasoning.
Subsequent work continued on in this direction, using ideas from</span><a class="firn-external" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370217300267" target="_blank">dialogue games</a><span> and </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10503-018-9474-x" target="_blank">argumentation theory more broadly</a><span>.</span></p></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="a-sketch-of-a-plan"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>A sketch of a plan</span></span></h1><section><p><span>So, having gotten together around these ideas, we’re having online
chat, frequent short meetings.  We’ve talked about maintaining a blog
that would describe what we’re learning and developing.  So, roughly
speaking, we will try to develop a curriculum through the blog.  We
also have this wiki, that any of us can edit, which we can use as a
staging ground for more developed blog posts.  Our thought was that
blog posts might move in the direction of more developed outputs,
whether products or research papers.  We want to use some ideas
adapted from Scrum to build a shared awareness of what’s going on.
However, we want to be careful not to become “managerial” since
everyone is currently here as a volunteer, working on topics of his or
her own interest.  We want to provide mutual support and fun.
Reflection, whether in writing, or by recording and listening again to
conversations, should help with that.  We are not constraining things
to come out in a purely structured curriculum, or any other form of
product development.  “Users” and “customers” may appear as we release
things we are happy with and expand our little community.</span></p><blockquote><p><span>“Rousseau says, someone who has been properly educated will be engaged
in society, but relate to his or her fellow citizens in a natural way.
... We naturally look after our own
preservation and interests.  By contrast, </span><em><span>amour-propre</span></em><span> is an unnatural
self-love that is essentially relational. ... Thus, </span><em><span>amour-propre</span></em><span> can
contribute positively to human freedom and even virtue. Nevertheless,</span><em><span>amour-propre</span></em><span> is also extremely dangerous because it is so easily
corruptible. ... In its corrupted form, </span><em><span>amour-propre</span></em><span> is the source of
vice and misery, and results in human beings basing their own self
worth on their feeling of superiority over others.” — </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://iep.utm.edu/rousseau/" target="_blank">IEP</a></p></blockquote></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="a-possible-formulation:-short-correlated-sprints-as-opposed-to-random-behaviour"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>A possible formulation: short correlated sprints as opposed to random behaviour</span></span></h1><section><p><span>“Two people working together 4 hours a week for two weeks” could serve
as an approximate unit of work.  Once we have amassed a few outputs
from this kind of effort, we will have some evidence of the kinds of
things that we can realistically achieve.  So far, our workflow has
been more based on solo activities and informal conversations, but
short robust team-ups continue to be an option!</span></p><blockquote><p><span>Hypothetical conversation: </span><em><span>In my next post I want to integrate something that I learned from you about PL.  I want to drive in the direction of synthesis, as hard as I know how to right now.  This depends on everyone having free time to invest in this.  Start a blog where we think about what's the overlap in terms of learning?</span></em></p></blockquote></section></div></div></div><div><hr /><div class="backlinks"><h4>Backlinks to this document:</h4><ul class="firn-backlinks"><li class="firn-backlink"><a href="https://exp2exp.github.io/sfi/sfi">Joe’s Santa Fe Institute proposal (Redux)</a></li><li class="firn-backlink"><a href="https://exp2exp.github.io/index">index</a></li><li class="firn-backlink"><a href="https://exp2exp.github.io/20200810131435-hyperreal_enterprises">Hyperreal Enterprises: Roadmap</a></li></ul></div></div></article></main></body></html>
