When it comes to Org Roam, note taking, directly helping people... I’ve been doing the most of this (w/ my thirst and knack for this).  This is the final layer of my deconstruction of this now.  So, I’d like to work on the tools, the agenda, the way we take notes, the ways we make those meetings more efficient; I think I need to make myself cognitively available for the technological task; and in addition I’m eager to create a meeting for package developers in the near future, so that I can think about this as a proper project.</span></p></li><li><p><span>NA: Yes; maybe if one of us takes the role of leading chair, it will give you the space to think about the technical solutions!</span></p></li><li><p><span>RP: And indeed I’d also like to get back to package developing.
