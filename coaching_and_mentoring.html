Part of that is down to the ε-baked nature of some of the proposals (0<ε<1), but surely another part of it is the competitive nature of the programmes I was applying to.  Presently I'm working on a short proposal for this "</span><a class="firn-external" href="https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/epsrc-mathematical-sciences-small-grants-scheme/" target="_blank">EPSRC mathematical sciences small grants scheme</a><span>" with another one in the works, though it might turn into something bigger or different.  It seems to me that writing a 6-month proposal is very good hygiene, since some of my previous attempts have come across as "ambitious" (read: full of hot air).  Building a suitable research track record seems like an art form. I've published a "reasonable amount" (</span><a class="firn-external" href="http://metameso.org/~joe/publications.html" target="_blank">http://metameso.org/~joe/publications.html</a><span>) but I also got a bit of a late start at this, since I only began my PhD at age 30 (I'm now 41) — having spent my 20s as a 'citizen scientist' and bohemian. Furthermore my research has been a bit hard to assign to any one research community.  In fact, to relate this a bit to HSS, I have long been interested in the "anthropology of modern mathematics".</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="(concern-2)-career-development-advice"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>(Concern 2) Career development advice</span></span></h2><section><p><span>As a Research Fellow in the Institute for Ethical AI, I am one of the few people in my group without "Senior" or similar in my job title (</span><a class="firn-external" href="https://ethical-ai.ac.uk/about/the-team/" target="_blank">https://ethical-ai.ac.uk/about/the-team/</a><span>). Brookes pays me less than I made as a postdoc, however I do appreciate the relative independence. Furthermore, as a single person and as-and-when practicing Buddhist, money and promotion aren't the most salient drivers in my life.  That said, I ()would?) love to develop my career in the direction of being part of a thriving research community and making a difference in the world to the extent that I'm able.  I'm very much involved in informal international research networks, but so far there's not a whole lot of "traction" between these activities and my day-job. Perhaps it's worth working to change that in some ways. E.g., at Brookes I've been asked to help set up the AI and Data Analysis Network and I think that's a good opportunity to bring my interests in peer learning to bear.  At the same time, it seems to me that winning grants is the #1 big ticket item for career progression!  I've also been getting involved with teaching as the instructor for Survey Fundamentals and as a tutor for Object Oriented Programming.  How to sort this relative to research?  I'm trying to channel Tim Ingold's energy about bringing students into the "powerhouse of knowledge construction", from "Anthropology is not Ethnography".

That's a good start but I may not yet have all the attributes needed to fully "go pro" on the basis of these skills alone.
