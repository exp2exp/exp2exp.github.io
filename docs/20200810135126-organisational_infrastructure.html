It looks at our
organisational infrastructure itself, including simple things like the
technologies we use for communication, and more involved things like
“how we communicate” more broadly.  (This is a good candidate for
splitting off into its own separate wiki, if for no other reason than
that it takes up a lot of space in the generated PDF.)</span></p></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="schedule-and-activities"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Schedule and activities</span></span></h1><section><p><span>Presently we are meeting 20 minutes a day at 4PM UK time, 11AM
Eastern, on Discord for a “coffee chat”.</span></p><p><span>Previously we tried to maintain a schedule of longer meetings (UK
evenings):</span></p><ul><li><p><strong><span>Monday</span></strong><span>: Seminar</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Wednesday</span></strong><span>: Workshop</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Friday</span></strong><span>: Studio</span></p></li></ul><p><span>That seemed to be too many meetings.  Whatever we do about regularly
scheduled meetings, we might want to look at how to best pursue of</span><strong><span>topics of mutual interest</span></strong><span> such as:</span></p><ul><li><p><strong><span>Readings</span></strong><span> on rewriting rules and production systems, and higher-dimensional graph-like things</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Business development</span></strong><span> around open source, knowledge management, etc.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Reviewing</span></strong><span> the value add of Wiki ways of thinking and working, which we have a pretty broad range of experience with</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>R&D</span></strong><span> around ‘lenses’ in ACT: structure for bi-directional transformations, to enable changes in a projection</span></p></li></ul><p><span>So far, this Roadmap has gathered information on some of the topics
that have been discussed, but not all of the things that we could see
ourselves working on together.</span></p><p><span>As another activity we may want to get scheduled one or more sessions
focused on business stuff.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="project-orientation"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Project orientation</span></span></h1><section><p><span>Some of this will be different depending on whether we think of this
as a “business”, or as “a business of some specific nature”: primarily
centring on “who does this business do business with?”</span></p><ul><li><p><strong><span>Status</span></strong><span> - where is the project right now?</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Right now </span><em><span>this overall project</span></em><span> is in a “project development” mode.</span></p></li><li><p><span>What are the (multiple) </span><em><span>success indicators</span></em><span> or </span><em><span>proof points</span></em><span> or </span><em><span>failure indicators</span></em><span> for each of the projects? (E.g., going to the casino with $20, you might quit when you get below $10, you might leave when you get above $50.) E.g., need of customers for X, our credibility in X?</span></p></li><li><p><span>For the various sub-projects: one relevant thing is “how long is it before thing is likely to make money?” (AKA, “Cross-over.”) Or “what else is needed for this to make money?”</span></p></li><li><p><span>In particular: maybe take a couple months to see how things are going with a given sub-project? This gives evidence of what we can produce when we work together. We might then ask, who else would care to pay for this?</span></p></li><li><p><span>We have listed 4 active projects (https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kmPNvaQ=/); maybe the blog is another one.</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong><span>Roles and Responsibilities</span></strong><span> - </span><em><span>who is handling the standard project roles, and what are they responsible for doing?</span></em></p><ul><li><p><span>Each individual sub-project is likely to have different requirements (e.g., some may need 2 people, some will need 1, etc.)</span></p></li><li><p><span>If there’s more than one person involved it becomes a parallel architecture</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong><span>Goals</span></strong><span> - </span><em><span>What will this project achieve?</span></em></p><ul><li><p><span>“If I do something valuable, the money will come later.”</span></p></li><li><p><span>Some of them we might be willing to take the risk of investing time and energy based on whether it looks directly useful to us.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Some, like a course, we may need the information about whether it’s likely to be taught.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Some could become a paper or the building block of a business: these can be small demo projects.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Alternatively, in a consulting mode, our role becomes understanding customer goals and helping rationalise work to fulfil them.</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong><span>Resource Requirements</span></strong><span> - </span><em><span>What (people, money, things) are needed to accomplish this project?
