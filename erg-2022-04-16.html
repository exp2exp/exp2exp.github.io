This helps us
reflect on what we did during the meeting, and sometimes allows us to
FORMULATE PERSPECTIVES THAT WEREN’T SURFACED DURING THE MEETING.  More recently,
we realised that the first question of the Project Action Review
(“Review the intention: what do we expect to learn or make together?”)
should be engaged with as a meta-point, early in the session.  Broadly
the PAR helps us to cultivate a sense of shared mindfulness about what
we’re doing.</span></p></blockquote><p><strong><span>Label</span></strong><span>: Meeting reviews</span></p><p><strong><span>Context</span></strong><span>: We’re going through meetings.</span></p><p><strong><span>Problem</span></strong><span>: Sometimes we don’t remember what we discussed, or don’t get a chance to say something important in the flow of conversation.  How do essentialise what we’re doing in a way we can think about later?</span></p><p><strong><span>Solution</span></strong><span>: Go back over the meeting with a different lens.</span></p><p><strong><span>Action</span></strong><span>: Answer these specific questions and make a record of the answers.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="a-possible-strategy"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>A possible strategy</span></span></h2><section><p><span>Since we ourselves are keen on making it practical, to directly help

some aligned in terms of problem, and some aligned in terms of
solution.  Decomposing them like this makes the map more obvious.
This is necessarily a simplification of the pattern.</span></p><p><span>You can have patterns like "I can’t start Emacs".  The action is
"Debug your init."  If you put some distance between the problem and
you, the meeting is a social moment, the PAR is meant to bring to the
surface a lot of stuff.  It’s meant to answer a number of problems.
It addresses </span><em><span>many</span></em><span> problems or surfaces-for-learning.</span></p><p><span>Maybe the PAR isn’t the pattern, reviewing the meeting is actually a</span><em><span>group</span></em><span> of patterns.  Each of the questions could be a different
pattern.</span></p><p><span>So, above, in the summary we simplify.  The </span><strong><span>context</span></strong><span> could then be
"Meeting review that we do at the end of the meeting".</span></p><p><span>Can we try to create a certain number of patterns that describe all
the functions that the PAR is hoping to achieve.  We might have a list
of contexts, problems, and solutions.  Actually we did this
organically by saying "Do we need the 1st question?"</span></p><p><span>Labels are good but maybe better to think about </span><strong><span>What is your current problem?</span></strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>If you’re confronted with a problem, just reading random patterns
won’t help.  "A Different Road" could point in different directions
but better to start with the list of problems here in the current
context.</span></p><p><span>"In software we start with formulating something as an opportunity to

interested in complexity.  And this means that a lot of people have
thought about patterns, but a lot of people also haven’t succeeded in
making a great pattern language.  Cybernetics had started after the

I currently like to wake up, not check the phone, and get straight to reading the Apprenticeship Patterns.  So this is a practice.</span></p><p><span>The way we were approaching the ‘context’ and ‘problem’ above are also anchor points upon which we can deploy a pattern and produce learning [JC: Or other outcomes?].</span></p><p><span>Feeling inspired by </span><em><span>patterns</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>evergreen notes</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>refinement</span></em><span>.  With patterns I like bio and chemistry metaphors; thinking about transmutating a problem into a solution, or making hay from the surface for learning.  There’s something transformational/transactional about patterns.</span></p><p><span>They’re often presented as antidotes to problems.  They make the problems (negative sense) go away.  So this is a kind of health metaphor.</span></p></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="why-did-the-patterns-not-stick?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Why did the patterns not stick?</span></span></h2><section><p><span>The ways of thinking about chemistry, botany, etc., provide abstract concepts that can be used for us to talk about patterns.</span></p><p><span>NA: Patterns are abstractions... I know that in the policy world, they create products called "toolkits" which are solutions to certain community problems, like "you’re having high blood pressure a lot in this community... you might want to stick to healthy lifestyles, get exercise, get educated about this stuff."</span></p><p><span>JC: That’s another interesting example of the essence of a pattern, or the abstraction of a pattern living in a community.  Some communities might have the habit of brushing their teeth without realising that it’s healthy, or eating a lot of salt without realising it’s unhealthy.</span></p><p><span>LV: Habits that </span><em><span>survive</span></em><span> might be linked to “actual problems”?  Maybe the high blood pressure example generates a checklist (cf. their use in medicine), of things to check.  In a group, in a social setting, trying to think about problems... it’s not necessarily thinking about problems and antidotes, and </span><em><span>how they impact the future</span></em><span>, or </span><em><span>how to steer in a different direction</span></em><span>.  It can remove something, or maintain the status quo.  E.g., a trend of climate change will continue or worsen.  But we could look at social conversations about problems-as-opportunities-for-learning to do more than just apply an antidote.</span></p><p><span>NA: How do we anticipate a different future?  Remember "Disasterology", they were talking about how, because policy-makers failed to anticipate, we draw on fiction writers to thin about climate and so on.</span></p><p><span>LV: The different versions of a problem: why do people brush teeth... they get grimy? they fall out?  But with climate change, it’s wider, linked with a community; it’s not obviously individualisable.</span></p><p><span>JC: If it’s an individual context, e.g. “everyone should brush their teeth”, you get your typical mathematical set/context; but with anticipation patterns/contexts, it’s very different.</span></p><p><span>JC: The “Review the context phase” highlights the inherent transformative role of those patterns.  Niche-construction means that we could change the context through repeated practice.</span></p></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="par"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>PAR</span></span></h1><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="1-establish-what-is-happening:-what-and-how-are-we-learning?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>1.
