Recently, the crdt.el package was
created to support multiple people editing the same Emacs buffer (like
Google Docs or Etherpad). In this project, the CRDT implementation
will be extended to share workspaces rather than single documents.Â 
One application is within the "Org Roam" note taking tool, which
currently supports individual users working on their own "personal
wiki". In this project, these features will be combined. The design
may take inspiration from an earlier </span><a class="firn-external" href="http://oro.open.ac.uk/29278/" target="_blank">demo of real-time web annotation</a><span>
and from </span><a class="firn-external" href="http://rudel.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">previous co-editing tools for Emacs</a><span>. The student taking on
this project should either be familiar with LISP or quick at picking
up programming languages. In addition to implementation, the project
should be accompanied by detailed documentation and backed up by user
research on how the tools influence collaborative work.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="implementing-an-automated-programming-system-using-contracts"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Implementing an automated programming system using contracts</span></span></h1><section><p><strong><span>Keywords</span></strong><span>: program synthesis, functional programming, evolutionary computing</span></p><p><span>Clojure allows typing information (and more) to be added to functions
using clojure.spec. This means that we can easily test function
implementations to see if they match their contracts: are the inputs
and outputs of the right type, and do the outputs have the right
relationships among them? This also suggests a way to put functions
together automatically, based on their types, composing a bigger
function that, itself, meets the correct specification. This project
will explore previous work on contract-based programming and genetic
programming, and implement a system that can discover novel useful
programs. The student taking on this project should either be familiar
with Clojure or with a strongly typed functional programming language
like Haskell. Relevant background reading includes this 2013 paper on

produced a computational model of one step in a simple but tricky
proof. The proof uses patterns of inference that are not well
represented in formal theorem proving systems (although the theorem
itself would have a straightforward formal proof). In this project, a
full computational implementation of the proof will be created,
expanding on the hypergraph-based models from the above-mentioned
paper. This project would be appropriate for a student with a strong
mathematics and computing background. A student who additionally has a
background in physics may wish to discuss relationships with ongoing
work in the Wolfram Physics project.</span></p></section></div></div></div></article></main></body></html>
