as too much of a 20th Century idea.  Instead we look at how the text
develops, as an example of a complex system.  We consider that larger
cultural systems have a similar property of capturing patterns in
informatic terms.  The patterns in our lives are similar.  Sometimes
they are very sticky, sometimes they are well-connected, sometimes
they are disparate and so on.  Measurement seems to be a game changer,
since it allows us to assess certain patterns and project them into a
domain that feels simple and familiar.  But more interesting than
measurement is the informatic relation itself, which is more related
to ‘learning’.  In this view we circle back to ask whether a text
itself can learn, rather than simply being informed.  We consider text
as a kind of ‘being’.  Text has a quantized self, which is different
from simply projecting into familiar numbering systems.  If we became
acquainted with the world of text we would start to see things in a
different way.
