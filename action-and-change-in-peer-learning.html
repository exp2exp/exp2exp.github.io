accomplished? What lessons should they take forward to improve their
future group studies?  This poster introduces a methodology others can
leverage for informal educational reflection using two lenses. First,
the "Paragogical Action Review", which was adapted from the well-known
After Action Review developed by the United States Army. Second,
Sohail Validity Inayatullah's "Causal Layered Analysis", a
method for envisioning transformation
(http://www.metafuture.org/Articles/CausalLayeredAnalysis.htm).</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="case-study"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>CASE STUDY</span></span></h1><section><p><span>Using the combined technique to examine two unsuccessful peeragogy

a coherent new future” (Wikipedia, 2020).  At each level we compare
the current reality with the future reality hinted at in the PARs.</span></p></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="the-litany"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>The litany</span></span></h3><section><p><span>The Peeragogy project was
convened by media scholar Howard Rheingold in 2012, charged with being
a living resource for "for any group of people who want to learn
anything." Our successful work since then includes multiple peer
reviewed papers and three editions of the Peeragogy Handbook. Since
one aim of peeragogy is to be explicit about how learning works, it
makes sense to investigate how to learn from failures and
successes.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="social-causes"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Social causes</span></span></h3><section><p><span>This poster show how using the combined PAR+CLA methods can surface emergent themes and diagnose trends.
Our aim with ‘peeragogy’ was to use peer learning to build better
support for peer learning (Corneli and Danoff, 2011).  Are we
successfully inventing ways of relating that address the needs of
people with limited access to educational opportunity? Can we extract
patterns from the literature on MOOCS, crowdfunding and other
collaborative projects that can be applied here?</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="structure"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Structure</span></span></h3><section><p><span>There are a bunch of innovative learning experiments going on, but it
can be hard to get a good overview, and access is very uneven.  Can we
develop our strategy for translating our learning within the peeragogy
project to (and from) diverse audiences?</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="metaphor-and-myth"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Metaphor and myth</span></span></h3><section><p><span>People often talk about great men and women, neglecting peers and
networks. We should nevertheless keep the Iron Law of Oligarchy in
mind as a dangerous attractor in peer production (Shaw & Hill, 2014)!
We can borrow a technique from religious studies (Batchelor, 2015),
and ask, how does peeragogy differ from other approaches?</span></p></section></div></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="references"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>References</span></span></h1><section><p><span>Corneli, J., & Danoff, C.
