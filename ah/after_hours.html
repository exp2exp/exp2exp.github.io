The disease was extremely deadly, and there were some complications
around the roll-out of the vaccine.  However, everyone now has access
to free medical care.  Nevertheless, because of ongoing concerns about
overpopulation and associated environmental degradation, people are
encouraged to have no more than one child.  Advancements in medical
technology mean that people tend to live longer.  Partly due to
population pressures on earth, humans are starting to colonise Mars
and to mine asteroids.  However, this work is considered to be
extremely dangerous.</span></p><p><span>BILL is a medical doctor specialising in synthetic biology.  He used
to have a club foot and went by the nick-name BILLY THE GIMP.  That
was a long time ago.  His foot has been repaired with surgery, leaving
only a slight limp.</span></p><p><span>MOLLY is Bill’s spouse and also his colleague at the hospital.  She
used to be a nurse but is now a senior biomedical researcher.</span></p><p><span>JOHN LONG is a retired doctor who MOLLY and BILL both used to work for
a long time ago, in somewhat different capacities.</span></p><p><span>Our protagonists, Molly and Bill — in keeping with the social mores of
the world they live in — have decided not to have children.</span></p><ul><li><p><a class="firn-internal" href="https://exp2exp.github.io/ah/story">BBC 28 March 2021</a></p></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="reference"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Reference</span></span></h1><section><ul><li><p><a href="#[[https:realitystudioorg"></a><span>]</span><a href="#[https:realitystudioorg"></a><span>]]</span></p></li></ul></section></div></div></div><div><hr /><div class="backlinks"><h4>Backlinks to this document:</h4><ul class="firn-backlinks"><li class="firn-backlink"><a href="https://exp2exp.github.io/other_stuff">Other stuff</a></li></ul></div></div></article></main></body><script>anchors.options = {
