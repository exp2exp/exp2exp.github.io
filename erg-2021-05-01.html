You can’t be part of the group unless you know the words that are used.  And this explains how things can become less diverse.</span></p></li><li><p><span>RSP: And you can then ask why that is the case.  E.g., we have the term ‘buffer’ so that’s important?  Or, that’s purely a historical accident and it excludes people who would otherwise be part of the discussion.</span></p></li><li><p><span>NA: So, the way I was thinking about it — remember the high school kid who presented at EmacsConf... I was blown away!  It was awesome how he was using Emacs.  That said, he’s studying at Stanford Online School or something, where all the resources are there for learning about this world.  I personally didn’t know about open source until I was in my mid-20s</span></p></li><li><p><span>RSP: That’s similar to me: I was going to a private school and happened to go to an activity at Columbia.  So if it is only at elite schools that is going to exclude a lot of people</span></p></li><li><p><span>NA: I remember that I got into it via ‘rooting’ the Google Nexus phone — and this opened some floodgates</span></p><ul><li><p><span>LV: and then 5 or 10 years later here we are...</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>LV: I’d like to recontextualise... to note: ‘diversity and emacs’ and the ‘EmacsConf improvement workshop’ are different</span></p></li><li><p><span>‘What is diversity in software’ is more of a scholarly question; not necessarily what we have to take into account within operationalising it in the EmacsConf</span></p><ul><li><p><span>We know which people are being concerned, and we know areas in which we are sorely lacking</span></p></li><li><p><span>The doctrine that we adopted was to come up with an “outreach programme” (which existed in the CFP last year, in the form of a paragraph)</span></p></li><li><p><span>Now trying to operationalise that, with office hours that are designed to be open</span></p></li><li><p><span>This can provide a certain number of outlets for people to express themselves; but these aren’t tagged as only “places for diversity” (e.g., comfortability presenting is an aspect of diversity, but that’s)</span></p></li></ul></li></ul></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="and-here-we-are-to-address-scholarly-questions!"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>And here we are to address scholarly questions!</span></span></h3><section><ul><li><p><span>RSP: But actually the question is too important to just be scholarly!</span></p></li><li><p><span>Somewhere there should be a place to have the broad-ranging discussion about ‘what is diversity’ and things like that</span></p></li><li><p><span>Charlotte would say “not everything does things in a scholarly way”</span></p></li><li><p><span>So, the broad discussion should exist and eventually inform EmacsConf</span></p></li><li><p><span>LV: In fact we do expect the discussion to be about ‘diversity’</span></p><ul><li><p><span>but we also have to share our thoughts</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>NA: A couple of things, we should be thinking about partnerships and ‘community engagement’ (not ‘outreach’ because engagement is a 2-way relationship: this is an example of language) — e.g., “</span><a class="firn-external" href="https://girlswhocode.com/" target="_blank">Girls Who Code</a><span>” is a great organisation that you could approach around engagement in programming and what it means to be open source</span></p><ul><li><p><span>We’re still thinking about FLOSS as philosophy, but let’s walk the talk! — by doing it in real project</span></p></li><li><p><span>We also have to think about it from the side of user, and from the side of developers; there’s a disconnect between users and developers who don’t actually talk with each other, or it can feel like a one-way conversation</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>LV: The problem we’ve encountered with EmacsConf is: we talk about diversity partly because we don’t understand what goes into it; user-developer or maintainer-to-maintainer relationships </span><em><span>might</span></em><span> go into diversity but it could be a better fit for </span><em><span>Emacs user groups</span></em><span>.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>I’ve been working to create more links, and now people are thinking about Org Roam as a highlight as a result, but I/we are also encouraging people to do the same</span></p></li><li><p><span>e.g., I was talking with the maintainer of TRAMP...</span></p></li><li><p><span>We’ve talked also about a “user group for maintainers”... now we’re thinking we should lead by example, e.g., blogging about emacs, or handholding by providing the facility to be as welcoming as possible</span></p></li><li><p><span>This could also include working with Girls Who Code</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>NA: We’ve talked about how documentation is a big hurdle — so how about creating </span><em><span>templates</span></em><span> — i.e., documentation templates, prompt questions</span></p><ul><li><p><span>In this section you can talk about the purpose of this package — what is the user experience — etc.</span></p></li><li><p><span>This sort of template should be helpful to maintainers and developers</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>LV: We’ve been working to nudge people towards this, but maintainers would have very little time or motivation to do so</span></p><ul><li><p><span>E.g., we do want to write an Org Roam tutorial, I have a feeling about the shape I want it to be — but it’s only a matter of finding the time?</span></p></li><li><p><em><span>try to be what we preach</span></em><span> — if we want people to do this then Org Roam should be the flagship for this.
