Block exporter working.  However, the </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://github.com/theiceshelf/firn/pull/85" target="_blank">screenshot in the pull request</a><span>
suggests that it may need some more effort to really be nice.  Still,
it’s a good start; clearly it gave me some more practice with Firn,
and I also dusted off my git branch maintenance manoeuvres.  Various </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://github.com/theiceshelf/firn/issues" target="_blank">issues</a><span> I’ve added to the
Firn issue tracker could provide starting points for further learning/improvement projects.
Routinely doing a bit of work on Firn is great for keeping my Clojure skills from going stale!</span></p><p><span>I also got on with reading some of the books related to “Survey
Fundamentals” including a chapter from the book on </span><em><span>Sampling</span></em><span> that Tim
recommended.  The first part of student projects will be due on
February 22nd, so the lecture for that day might give some previews of
everything else to come in the semester.  We’re getting past the
design and piloting stage and onto data collection and analysis: so,
this part will be more quantitative.  I’m a little bit intimidated
because my own background in stats is less thorough than that of the
students, but I figure we can make it through together.  The class so
far has had a decent level of peer learning in it.</span></p><p><span>I did the necessary outreach to get a “research mentor” on the Brookes
faculty, and sent a little introductory note.  It’s now time to follow
up with some more concrete efforts.  Also related to research at
Brookes, my colleagues in IEAI are happy to be involved on the project
I’ll be pitching, and they asked some good questions about it that
prompt some revision of the draft.</span></p><p><span>Relatedly, we had a reasonably successful “2nd soft launch” event for
the AI and Data Analysis Network (AIDAN), and I collected a few PostIt
notes on that, summing up what people said they want from the network.
AIDAN continues to seem like peeragogy in action, on some level,
though since it’s within an institution the incentive structures are a
bit different from those found “in the wild”.</span></p><p><span>Minor business details: I unsubscribed from Miro (which I wasn’t using
anymore); and Starling credited my account with a £1250 bonus for
switching to them, so that’s cool, and got me wondering again about
what we might be able to make out of the HEL business.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="for-the-week-ahead"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>For the week ahead</span></span></h1><section><p><span>My personal Scrum board looks a lot like Space Invaders.  Aside from
teaching obligations, the most immediately pressing items are to
finalise the Intent to Submit form for my small grant proposal, and to
finish preparing a talk about Serendipity that I’ll deliver on
Thursday at 1400 GMT — I’ll also want to drop into some of the other
activities during the week!</span></p></section></div></div></div><hr /><div class="back"><p>Back to blog: <a href="https://exp2exp.github.io/updates.html">Exp2Exp: Updates</a></p></div></article></main></body></html>
