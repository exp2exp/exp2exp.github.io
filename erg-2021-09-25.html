We can also talk about the "patterns" - a pattern language for meeting and organising our activities.

These are places where we are walking nearer to the frontier of what’s possible with Emacs.  With people who have expertise in Elisp we can push the boundaries of the circle; it’s an iterative process of improvement in which we’re taking part.  ERG was concerned about the circle of Emacs, but any Emacsian endeavour seems DOOMED to improve Emacs.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><h4 class="firn-headline firn-headline-4" id="bridge-points-between-our-two-presentations-are-going-to-be-important"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Bridge points between our two presentations are going to be important</span></span></h4><section><ul><li><p><span>Non-exclusive candidates</span></p><ul><li><p><span>From tools (from last time) to researching the tools themselves</span></p></li><li><p><span>Tools enable methods which inform patterns  TO BE REFINED)</span></p></li></ul></li></ul></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="considerations-on-writing-the-submission-form"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Considerations on writing the submission form</span></span></h3><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><h4 class="firn-headline firn-headline-4" id="how-to-come-up-with-a-title?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>How to come up with a title?</span></span></h4><section><ul><li><p><span>It might be easier to think about the themes and then reflect them in the title.</span></p></li></ul></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="submission-form"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Submission form</span></span></h3><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><h4 class="firn-headline firn-headline-4" id="name:"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Name:</span></span></h4><section><p><span>Emacs Research Group</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><h4 class="firn-headline firn-headline-4" id="title:"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Title:</span></span></h4><section><p><em><span>ERG-Tech: Research in, on, and with Emacs: Lost in La Mancha</span></em></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><h4 class="firn-headline firn-headline-4" id="abstract:"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Abstract:</span></span></h4><section><ul><li><p><span>5-10 minutes: (brief description/outline)</span></p><ul><li><p><span>short version</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong><span>20 minutes: (brief description/outline)</span></strong><span> [We will aim for this one]</span></p><ul><li><p><span>medium version</span></p></li><li><p><span>3 points</span></p><ul><li><p><em><span>We wanted to do research in, on, and</span></em><span> </span><strong><span>with</span></strong><span> </span><em><span>Emacs</span></em></p></li><li><p><em><span>WITH here means research on how to use Emacs to run a meeting or organisation</span></em></p></li><li><p><em><span>How we think about tech inform how we do research and vice versa</span></em></p></li><li><p><span>We can show the process of how we run our meetings, how we load up CRDT, one of us will take the lead on writing note, how Git checks it out.</span></p></li><li><p><span>we could all show our screen to show that we’re all in the same document even though we have different set-ups</span></p></li><li><p><span>In a similar (rich) VEIN to how we presented Season Zero... now we’re doing the behind the scenes for something that hasn’t come out publicly yet; it could be a 2 minute presentation of Leo doing the setup, then, the video,</span></p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><span>40 minutes: (brief description/outline)</span></p><ul><li><p><span>More than we need</span></p></li></ul></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><h4 class="firn-headline firn-headline-4" id="availability-and-preferred-q&amp;a-approach:"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Availability and preferred Q&A approach:</span></span></h4></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><h4 class="firn-headline firn-headline-4" id="speaker-release:"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Speaker release:</span></span></h4><section><blockquote><p><span>By submitting this proposal, I agree that my presentation at
