I’ll start with </span><a class="firn-internal" href="https://exp2exp.github.io/cla-16-october-2021">CLA 16 October 2021</a><span> from ERG.  There are plenty of
overlaps in terms of people and processes.  However, this will need
considerable adaptation to take into account the data we’ve been
gathering in our Discord (particularly in PARs by Joe and Alex).</span></p></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="litany"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Litany</span></span></h1><section><p><span>We’ve made progress since we started with the raw themes of Research
on/in/with Emacs back in October 2020. We’ve met almost every week
since then, and interviewed some interesting and varied guests. We
have a clearer idea of what what we want to talk about at the next
EmacsConf, and how we can be of service to researchers and Emacs
users. We have been using a workflow that helps us carefully review
progress, diagnose issues, and manage our energy.  We’re understanding
how research is done by doing it, and keeping careful track of the
process. If a session doesn’t go as well as hoped, we think about why
(especially Leo as chair). The idea is that you know what the bomb is, so you can at
least hope to defuse it later. We try to adapt gracefully to
circumstances as they evolve, without being reactive because we know
we will be back again next week and the week after, etc.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="system"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>System</span></span></h1><section><p><span>If we tackle big enough projects, it will bring with it the need for
collaboration. (And we need to respect these other parties.) We like
to create tangible deliverables (e.g., journal articles). However,
“If we knew what the outcome was it wouldn’t be research” — therefore,
we’re focusing initially on research methods and design documents. So
far many of the stakeholders have to do with free software, open
communities, peer learning: all of this is part of a broader
initiative. All of them will need some degree of systematised
activities and documents. This is what we’re experimenting with; in
principle, we can provide meta-management workflows.  In the way we work together we make sure
to take account of emotions, not just a time table. We’ve been
experimenting with futures methods that help us use the future
intelligently: neither trying to do everything ‘live’, nor
overburdening the future with a bunch of plans that can’t be
realised.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="worldview"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Worldview</span></span></h1><section><p><span>We have looked at RStudio and Roam Research as models of (some of) the
kinds of things we think Emacs can eventually improve upon. Actually
getting there requires thinking about the specificity of what Emacs
can do. At least nominally, it is a system for editing. For example,
currently we can edit a wiki using Org Roam and Git. What about
editing distributed knowledge graphs? This would allow people to
reference ongoing research processes. Or we could go further and
contribute to the development of a new distributed read-write Web!
Alongside such software products could come various services, such as
a matchmaking service for academics, or a set of 24/7 virtual
conferences. To make such thing really useful, we need to get
coherence out of various long-running, diverse, and hetereogeneous
thought processes: and make sure we help people address real
problems. We can start small, working with the members of ERG and
their networks. We’re certainly not the only people who are struggling
with some unexpected commitments.  Successful adaptation requires the
articulation of an entire system. Thinking again about Emacs: its
current documentation is certainly useful, but it leaves many gaps,
some of which are filled in other ways (e.g., by mailing lists). As we
work we are paying attention to the growth not only of knowledge, but
also of capability. For this, we often rely on our feelings (getting
it, not getting it, accomplishing something or not, etc.).</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="myth"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Myth</span></span></h1><section><p><span>In our concrete methods, we have aligned ourselves with the ‘long-term
perspective’. This includes both retrospective and prospective
thinking. For example, the things that were timely 7 years ago might
not be now; in many cases the relevance of a given innovation goes down over
time. That said, Emacs has an evolutionary character that has
allowed it to keep up with the times — apparently becoming
increasingly relevant and useful ever since Steele and Stallman
started to systematise Editor MACroS for the Text Editor and Corrector
(TECO) program. Not only has the technology evolved, but so has the
social setting in which this work is done. After nearly a year of
working together, we’re now prepared to argue that other people should
consider getting together to create their own communities similar to
ours! The concepts underlying the free software movement were based on
“communal sharing” of source code: now we’re working on developing and
sharing other methods as well. Just like free software has
legitimately expanded the range of what’s humanly possible, so too may
further efforts expand frontier of possibility. As above, this takes
careful articulation, and a willingness to do truly original research
(without relying on fixed assumptions about what research is meant to
be, or where we will find value).</span></p></section></div></div></div></article></main></body><script>anchors.options = {
