I’ll start with </span><a class="firn-internal" href="https://exp2exp.github.io/cla-16-october-2021">CLA 16 October 2021</a><span> from ERG.  There are plenty of
overlaps in terms of people and processes.  However, this will need
considerable adaptation to take into account the data we’ve been
gathering in our Discord (incluing PARs by Joe and Alex).</span></p><p><span>I did some sketching in </span><code>/home/joe/new-cla</code><span>.</span></p></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="litany"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Litany</span></span></h1><section><p><span>Hyperreal Enterprises Limited was </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://hyperreal.enterprises/" target="_blank">incorporated</a><span> on June 25th 2019,
initially around a call for proposals that was circulated by </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://conexus.com/company/about/" target="_blank">Conexus</a><span>.</span><strong><span>However</span></strong><span>, in the end we didn’t submit </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://exp2exp.github.io/conexus_proposal" target="_blank">our proposal</a><span>, because we felt
that Conexus wanted projects that were further along.</span></p><p><span>During the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic, Joe was enrolled at
Entrepreneur First and tried out a range of business ideas related to
the themes we’ve been talking about.  </span><strong><span>However</span></strong><span>, none of these turned
into a pitchable business, despite some progress on product
development.</span></p><p><span>Also during this time, a group of friends started to meet on Fridays
for informal discussion around some of the developing ideas.  Since
then, these discussions morphed into brief daily calls, and eventually
into longer daily calls.  These calls broadly focus on “peer support”
rather than strictly focusing on business or product development (for
example).  Our culture is a bit like that of the </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algonquin_Round_Table" target="_blank">Algonquin Round Table</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Many of the involved persons have been involved in </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://exp2exp.github.io/erg" target="_blank">collaborative research on Emacs</a><span>
and in </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10497" target="_blank">research on collaboration</a><span> per se.  One of the early unifying themes around Hyperreal
was to keep track of how we were learning things, and try to make what we were learning
“reproducible” for others.</span></p><p><span>Alongside our peer support calls, we’ve also experimented with reading
and study groups that help us study topics of mutual interest.  Topics
covered include: clojure programming, basic algorithms, logic
programming, startup culture, real-time collaborative editing, futures
methods and distributed problem solving, and as well as the
Emacs-related work mentioned above.  These are at various stages of
development.  We also brought some Master’s supervision work into the
shared practice space.</span></p><p><span>With these projects we’ve experimented with different ways of
reviewing progress, diagnosing issues, and managing our energy.  One
asynchronous feature is an “intention-based” chat that sprawls across
various virtual locations in our virtual office park.</span></p><p><span>We’ve focused a lot of energy on developing a shared ‘mindfulness’
practice, insofar as we are always working to listen well and
communicate clearly around topics of shared interest.  We’ve been
relationship- and person-centred.  Inspiring cultures of collaboration
range from the Sangha that grew up around Gotama to the beanbag-based
feedback circle at Xerox PARC, as well as our experience with other
earlier and ongoing online collaborations.  By maintaining different
‘rhythms’ of collaboration and different subgroups, we have been able
to experiment with different ways of working.</span></p><p><span>We have typically been able to defuse “co-founder risk” by tabling
emotions and practicing sincere and respectful communication.
Naturally, some of the early participants have had other priorities
and have not stuck around.  Presently we’re in a position where the
ongoing daily calls can help to support other circa-weekly activities
and vice versa.</span></p><p><span>Because we’ve so far been committing to show up just every day and to
stay reasonably productive while also supporting one anothers’
thriving, we’ve built (or deepened) our rapport.</span></p></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="projects"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Projects</span></span></h2><section><ul><li><p><span>PLACARD paper</span></p></li><li><p><span>Emacs conf lunch presentation</span></p></li><li><p><span>Cool flaws workshop</span></p></li><li><p><span>Peeragogy mini-handbooklet</span></p></li><li><p><span>Reasoned schemer read</span></p></li><li><p><span>Ob-servant and hypernotebook</span></p></li><li><p><span>CRDT</span></p></li></ul></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="system"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>System</span></span></h1><section><p><span>Thanks in part to the Peeragogical way of working, we find ourselves
collaborating in a loose network.  Typically, each of the participants
in Hyperreal brings some of their own collaborations, e.g., in
research (whether linked to formal employment or other informal
collaborations) or Free/Libre/Open Source Software: or even in
personal life.  We’ve also been aware of the need to be well grounded
in our individual lives through sport, meditation, diligence in work,
or other forms of deliberate (etc.).  The regular meeting times and
attention to quality of discourse therein have helped to support this.</span></p><p><span>With the various meeting topics mentioned above, sometimes the topics
drift (cf. </span><a class="firn-external" href="http://scansitu.antipool.org/6004.html" target="_blank">Open Creation and its Enemies</a><span> by Asger Jorn and </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://monoskop.org/images/6/6b/Eco_Umberto_The_Open_Work.pdf" target="_blank">The Open
Work</a><span> by Umberto Eco).  Since we don’t want everything to dissolve into
a mishmash, we’ve been trying to keep the main focus relatively
clearly delineated in the various sub-projects and sub-fora.  Such
clarification is still ongoing work-in-progress (with the
‘intention-based’ chats mentioned above being one of the pilots).</span></p><p><span>Our shared </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://exp2exp.github.io/" target="_blank">wiki</a><span> touches on some of the ideas and motivations that have
occurred to us.  We have managed to generate some joint outputs for
EmacsConf 2020 and 2021, as well as PLoP 2021.</span></p><p><span>We haven’t focused so much on product or business development since
the Entrepreneur First days.  In principle we could get back to that,
but presently our joint activities seem to be focused more on learning
and research, with peer support for individual activities also taking
high priority.  That said, some product or service development ideas
may emerge from these research directions, e.g., work on </span><a class="firn-external" href="http://arxana.net/" target="_blank">Arxana</a><span> is
likely to be revitalised by our work with logic programming.
Similarly, the </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://exp2exp.github.io/report_on_first_placard_workshop" target="_blank">PLACARD workshop</a><span> is something that we think we could
run (with adaptations) with in various settings to benefit a variety
of initiatives.</span></p><p><span>If we had some money, we almost certainly would have the technical
talent around to soak some of it up.  However, we’re not yet ready to
pitch to investors, and the product/service development isn’t yet at a
point where we can put things in front of paying customers.  One
strategy for getting money would be to have one of our </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://hyperreal.enterprises/history.html" target="_blank">research
projects</a><span> funded (as a research project) and then to build a product
around it later.  In this regard, modelling open source knowledge
bases continues to be a likely bet (as in the Conexus proposal, in
fact).  We’ve also seen that some stakeholders in “wikis” and
“knowledge management tools” may be interested in the kinds of things
we could offer on a software consultancy basis.</span></p><p><span>Presently, this CLA—which is based loosely on one developed by the
Emacs Research Group—is helping provide an anchor point for our
developing plans.  The </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://exp2exp.github.io/" target="_blank">wiki</a><span> provides another quite different
perspective.  In fact we’ve been writing together on wikis and
elsewhere for a while and have some other </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://github.com/holtzermann17/AsteroidMetaArchive" target="_blank">related notes</a><span> in </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://github.com/holtzermann17/planetmath-docs/labels/PREVIEW" target="_blank">various
places</a><span> that we could get some value from by collating here.</span></p><p><span>As we keep working, we will presumably adopt the PLACARD method from
our PLoP paper to keep refining the CLA.  Presently, we have some PARs
that can be used to round out the initial perspectives here.  This way
of working could be supported with some lightweight tools (e.g., an
email address for logging PARs, or an easy way to tag TODO items with
design patterns held in a shared repository).</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="worldview"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Worldview</span></span></h1><section><p><span>We noticed that by using the curvature of the earth it would be
possible to provide continuous global coverage with an ongoing
neverending “Jazz night”.  For example, if proponents of Hyperreal
were located at 5 equidistant Longitudes around Earth, we would have
complete coverage in daily five-hour shifts, though it would be rather
lonely without people in nearby timezones to talk to.</span></p><p><span>It can’t be too hard to create such a service; simply getting it up
and running would be one approach to addressing the chicken-and-egg
problem of “capacity building”.</span></p><p><span>There are, of course, other approaches, and since we are currently
distributed between the Central Europe and Pacific time zones, a daily
or weekly “pulse” makes sense for now.</span></p><p><span>We’re also working on getting our technical tooling into the best
shape, e.g., with Git, Org Mode, and CRDT tools for collaboration in
the short run, and things Arxana possibly starting to become useful
later on.</span></p><p><span>Broadly we’re only as effective as the sum (or perhaps, the
completion) of the individuals involved.  As such, our shared
worldview seems to put “practice” at the centre.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="myth"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Myth</span></span></h1><section><p><span>Hyperreal Enterprises derives some of its mythos from a </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://exp2exp.github.io/time_capsule" target="_blank">Time Capsule</a><span>
created Fri, 01 Apr 2005.  At a deeper level it draws on the idea of
‘hyperreality’ as developed by Jean Baudrillard.  As per the</span><a class="firn-external" href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/baudrillard/" target="_blank">Baudrillard</a><span> page in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, /‘people
live in the “hyperreality” of simulations in which images, spectacles,
and the play of signs replace the concepts of production and class
conflict as key constituents of contemporary societies’./</span></p><p><span>If we embrace this idea and take it forward further, we’re led to the
view that we could build informational systems that can shift
mainstream reality.  There have been clear proof-of-concepts in the
Web and Wikipedia.  The sense that these are only some of the early
examples of in a genre is one of the tenets of Hyperreal Enterprises.
In-house, our Coffee Chats are overlayed on our ‘real’ lives and seem
to provide a sense of meaning that isn’t readily found elsewhere.  As
Baudrillard says elsewhere:</span></p><p><span>/‘Excluded from the game, their revolt henceforth aims at the rules of
the game. This revolt can remain ambiguous if it is experienced as
anomie and as defeat, if it occupies by default the marginal position
assigned to it by the system or if it is institutionalized as
marginal. But it is enough that it radically adopts this forced
exteriority to the system in order to call the system into question,
no longer as functioning in the interior but from the exterior, as a
fundamental structure of the society, as a code, as a culture, as an
interiorized social space.’/</span></p><p><span>A meaningful symbol is the crow, a social tool-using bird, and the
idea of a “fake fake” from Philip K. Dick.</span></p><p><span>/‘Imagine the horror the Disneyland officials would feel when they
discovered the cruel hoax. Real birds! And perhaps someday even real
hippos and lions.’/</span></p></section></div></div></div></article></main></body><script>anchors.options = {
