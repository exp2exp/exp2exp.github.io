In the process I marked a few duplicates, not-obviously-doable, and outdated items as </span><code>WONTFIX</code><span>.
I also did some work on the ‘</span><a class="firn-external" href="https://peeragogy.org/top" target="_blank">Top-level</a><span>’ page, which has most of the makings of poetic overview of
what’s going on with Peeragogy.  The packets of tasks are viewable on the </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://peeragogy.org/tags" target="_blank">tags</a><span> page.</span></p><p><span>So, that nearly finishes off the earlier goal of ‘patternizing’ the
major sections — at a draft status with minimal patterns — though
there are a few more to add, in the </span><em><span>Technologies</span></em><span> and </span><em><span>Case studies</span></em><span>
sections.  It would make sense to bring along some short patterns
dealing with the </span><em><span>technologies</span></em><span> sections for Wednesday the 12th, when
I’m planning to meet with Ray to discuss “Tools for Thought Revisited”
in preparation for an internal talk taking place on the 18th.</span></p><p><span>By the way, one reason I know these specific forward-looking
calendrical details is that I missed a one-hour presentation on Friday
since there wasn’t a calendar reminder about it — and as a result I
proposed that we include some forward-planning for the week ahead in
the checkout at ERG.</span></p><p><span>The other major thing I moved forward was work on the HCI Ethics
slides, which I converted with this massive </span><code>pandoc</code><span> oneliner:</span></p><pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">pandoc --citeproc --bibliography /home/joe/hci-ethics-readings.bib \
       --csl=chicago-fullnote-bibliography-short-title-subsequent.csl \
       -M suppress-bibliography=true \
       HCCC-storyboard.org --to pptx -o HCCC-storyboard.pptx
</code></pre><p><span>The resulting </span><code>.pptx</code><span> file could be loaded into Google Slides for
discussion with Luís, though we haven’t overlapped for a live
discussion about this stuff yet.  I’m thinking of the result as a
‘storyboard’, not yet a draft, but something more than just a detailed
outline.  The strategy of writing </span><em><span>outline</span></em><span> → </span><em><span>treatment</span></em><span> → </span><em><span>storyboard</span></em><span> → </span><em><span>draft</span></em><span>
makes some sense for a big piece like this.</span></p><p><span>Another thing I worked on was a shorter set of slides for the Feeling
Zembla talk with Thomas.</span></p></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="other-reflections"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Other reflections</span></span></h1><section><p><span>Over the weekend I did some reflection, coming up with some bullet
points that could start to outline a vision for the future on the
1½-years scale.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>We have submitted some ‘short’ proposals that decompose the </span><em><span>discovery</span></em><span> theme into doable packets.</span></p></li><li><p><span>We have written some Clojure code that operationalises program discovery.</span></p></li><li><p><span>I have written about 1000 pages of typescript developing different ideas and possibilities.</span></p></li><li><p><span>We have a business plan for Hyperreal Enterprises ready to run and some evidence that it works.</span></p></li><li><p><span>The business plan has a cognate research plan ready to submit to an agency like the European Research Council or EPSRC.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Things have gone well developing AIDAN and it can be used as a model case study within the next version of the Peeragogy Handbook.</span></p></li><li><p><span>I have gotten to know people here in Oxford and am happy with the state of my relationships.</span></p></li><li><p><span>I have kept up my reading on philosophy of technology and would be ready to write a book in this area, or to do a second PhD or supervise someone else’s PhD on these topics.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Things are going well with Alex’s career and with the careers of everyone who put in some time and effort in Hyperreal.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>We also had a lively session at </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://exp2exp.github.io/erg-2021-05-08" target="_blank">ERG</a><span>.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="feeling-status"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Feeling status</span></span></h1><section><p><span>I’m not sure if it is </span><em><span>as a result</span></em><span> of the planning and other
activities, or just the way things are shaping up around my flat right
now — or if I’ve onboarded a virus or some allergies or something —
but I’ve felt very tired on Monday morning (including when I’m writing
this).  So, I’ll try to revisit the above at a time when I’m feeling
more with it.</span></p><p><span>My guess is that I’m tired </span><em><span>because</span></em><span> I have taken a break from the
various ‘good habits’ I defined — by and large they should be
restoring me rather than costing energy.  But it’s hard to do things
like, e.g., </span><a class="firn-internal" href="https://exp2exp.github.io/Writing">write</a><span>, if I am feeling tired.  I think part of the
solution is to try to spend more time during the day roaming through
the items here on Exp2Exp, so that I have the sense of being prepared.
The other thing is to add in more wind-down time in the evening.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="next-steps"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Next steps</span></span></h1><section><p><span>I still have a bunch of things in my agenda that look like personal
planning and processing, so these are going to have to be
priortised. I’d like to see somewhat more specific progress on the
individual topics, but probably working back from the ‘vision’
mentioned above to think about the things that can actually be done to
support it would make sense as a place to start.</span></p><p><span>There’s an Oxford AI meetup this evening that looks like an
interesting one — but of course that interferes with the time I would
spend writing.  Maybe I can try turning on the video and put it on as
a background process, though that sounds a extremely dubious.  (I
wonder if they are recorded?) Or, maybe I should just go ahead and
attend it this time if I’m still feeling under the weather.</span></p><p><span>Other than all this, I’ll have some meetings on Friday to revisit the </span><a class="firn-internal" href="https://exp2exp.github.io/clustering">grant</a><span> that went in while ago.
And there are a few other writing projects I’d like to get started on.  In the big picture, I think </span><a class="firn-internal" href="https://exp2exp.github.io/arxana">Arxana</a><span>
is what’s most in scope this quarter, since I want to be working towards another small proposal about that.</span></p></section></div></div></div></article></main></body><script>anchors.options = {
