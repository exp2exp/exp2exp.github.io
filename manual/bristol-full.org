* Open Future Design workshop: Introduction
:PROPERTIES:
:tag: :HL:WS:
:CUSTOM_ID: b7b42aa2-c57c-4bcc-bc45-be9b63972be7
:END:

** Overview

Our /Open Future Design/ (OFD) workshop is mirrored by a collaboration
method called "PLACARD" that scaffolds social perception, cognition,
and action.[fn:: fullcite:patterns-of-patterns]  PLACARD combines design patterns
with futuring exercises and review processes.  The OFD workshop walks
participants through a cycle of creative learning using these methods,
which they can later reuse on their own.  Our intention with the
workshop is, therefore, primarily to introduce new collaboration
methods and to show how they are effective.

Applications of the method range from building new platforms for
collaborative design and citizen science, to assisting on-the-ground
innovation projects.  In the workshop format, we work from the
assumption that we are talking to groups of people who have not yet
formed a strong group identity, and who are not necessarily all going
to work together on one highly cohesive project, but who are likely to
need to communicate with each other in the future.  We make structural
use of breakout groups and full-group discussions to gather
information at different levels of significance.  We also introduce a
technology-assisted quasi-real-time sensemaking process, which allows
participants to focus on content, while the technology helps to weave
new meanings at the context level.

** Outcomes and Evalution

*** Intermediate artifacts

- Mindmaps created with participants
- Group insights in a form of shared future stories

*** Output

- A constellation of interrelated design patterns outlining potential paths of action, produced by a diverse group of experts based on a collaborative analysis of complex challenges.

*** Outcomes

- Leverage in a complex challenges, based on a shared understanding of the core issues and a well-articulated design strategy.
- Time-savings, a unified action-orientation, and further multi-lateral relationships, as compared with more naive methods such as interviews, discussions, and focus groups.
- Potential next steps may include new communities of practice, and new initiatives (e.g., grant proposals, working groups).

*** Narrative Example

On November 3rd, 2022 we ran a pilot workshop in Bristol with the
theme “Public Space and Public Health”.  This brought together 8
people with varied expertise on these themes for a structured
discussion.  We discussed the theme, and potential scenarios for
development.  We then zoomed in on one of the scenarios, and discussed
its surrounding motivations.  In follow-up analysis, the facilitators
identified new ‘design patterns’ that could enable workshop
participants to solve the problems they identified.  On November 17,
2022, we ran a second pilot with a group of futurists at the
Anticipation conference in Tempe, Arizona, focused on workshopping the
methods.  Following this pilot we reflected on how we could make
better use of the direct particpants’ skills to facilitate broader
uptake beyond the activities in the room.

On January 23, 2023 we ran a longer workshop on a similar theme to the
first pilot: "Public space for public health: a call to action".  This
time, there were approximately twice as many participants, and we had
most of the day together.  We had made several changes to the
structure of the workshop.  In the first session, we used a
multi-stage share-back process to understand layered meanings.  In the
second session, we used manipulatives to elaborate design solutions.
In both phases, participants were accompanied by a remote team that
worked to make sense of data coming from the room.  Each break out
group was additionally supported by one or more persons who had
attended the initial pilot.

*** Limitations

Interrater reliablity regarding pattern identification from workshop
discussions can be presumed to be low.  We have addressed this concern
through the multi-layered data-gathering protocol, which (in Phase I)
gives us data that is structured along dimensions which lend
themselves to pattern analysis; and (in Phase II) through an activity
that directly involves participants in collaboratively formulating
pattern descriptions.  Even so, the utility of these patterns as paths
to action can only be evaluated later (Phase III, ‘after the
workshop’).

* Funding of public space

:END:

** Problem summary
Even though public space is known to increase wellness in the population, well-being priorities that would lead to increased funding for public space aren’t universally adopted.
** Solution summary

Funders typically needs to show some ‘return on investment’ HOWEVER, in the UK funding often goes to projects for digital innovation and other perceived economic growth areas, rather than towards investments in a well-being agenda.

BECAUSE the values upheld by the current UK government (and some devolved governments) lean towards enterprise, it may be possible in these constituencies to develop a well-being agenda within a ‘social enterprise’ framework, investing locally while integrating community into the design process.   There are many examples to learn from, i.e., both in terms of their successes and failures.  These include the Bristol Pound, which aimed to keep cash in the local economy (and which in its latest iteration might have provided a nice open data set around local investments) and Froom social enterprise efforts which built nice social housing and schools.

In Wales, there is legislation, in the form of the [[https://www.gov.wales/well-being-future-generations-wales-act-2015-guidance][Well-being of Future Generations Act 2015]], which enshrines a well-being agenda into law, and which has been monitored according to national indicators, in “Wellbeing of Wales” [[https://www.gov.wales/wellbeing-wales][reports]]. THEREFORE, a similar level of transparency around social enterprise investments could show where money is going, and help negotiate a well-being agenda that isn’t legislated.

Historically, investment in public space and community has come from different places and aligned with different value systems (e.g. medieval churches were often at the centre of local communities, now many are unused and available for sale); Kew was 1p to get in via the turnstile; modern architecture had a long phase in which public space was an afterthought at best.  Now, contemporary architecture and urban planning initiatives are rediscovering these social values and, SPECIFICALLY, this may provide a niche for social enterprise to engage.
* Rebalance social services
:PROPERTIES:
:tag: :HL:BF:
:CUSTOM_ID: 0f9e1955-845f-419d-bb55-70051d5df2c3
:END:

** Problem summary

Some behaviours require policing, however, if the balance is incorrect, then self-expression suffers.  Similarly, other welfare-related services should be supplied in balance with local needs, though they often are not.

** Solution strategy

Police and other social services exist to deal with problems which are not addressed on their own, HOWEVER in the right environment, criminality, disease, etc., either go away entirely or shrink to a minimum.

BECAUSE there is a limited amount of funding for public services, communities are now faced with dilemmas like closing the library to pay for the park, or removing bus services to pay for police, etc.; and, in fact, the police are already having to deal with a range of social problems which aren’t strictly within their remit, as are teachers and other service providers.  Whereas there used to be a /community policeman/ who could act with discretion, police officers now are oftentimes are not members of the communities they are meant to serve.  Other service provision can feel similarly remote and disconnected.

THEREFORE, what’s needed are more people in the community who provide good examples of — and paradigms for — action, more immediately and directly.  One strategy to pursue would be to arrange it so that the organisations that provide welfare services are connected with each other.  Much in the way that food co-ops can serve the alimentary needs of a community, other more integrated systems could be devised to tackle the structural issues that made apparent by current regimes of underfunding and disorganisation.  For example, Houston, Texas, significantly reduced homelessness by developing a continuum of care approach.  Other societal challenges might be addressed similarly.

SPECIFICALLY, it may be possible, in Bristol, to create a /radical public space/ that is taken care of by local people, which provides a range of relevant services.  Some good examples of community centres already exist, though they aren’t yet widespread into all of the communities that need them.  This could be an example of [[id:570f3d11-d1f6-4ffb-87ed-c815e7efe624][Communal spaces]].  However, there’s more than just a ‘space’ aspect to such a place.  Organisations like Médicins Sans Frontièrs show that experts are willing to activate around identified needs: can varied expertise be integrated in a similar way to address complex local challenges?

This strategy relates to the concept of /facilitator load/ that Abby talked about in the Bristol workshop.  As such we have an experience inside the workshop of (potentially) too many things to think about and an over-extended service provision.  This relates to the concept of [[id:80a6488b-af62-4340-b542-eecb6b922343][Volatility]].

** Problem summary

So-called public space doesn’t always necessarily feel welcoming to
all members of the public.  It can be overrun with antisocial
behaviour.  It can feel exclusionary, or uninviting.  It can be the
site of conflict.  When we enter public space, we may see others there
only in terms of their stereotypes.

** Solution summary

Public space can feel uninviting: it may be an “only” space; it may be
“only space”.  HOWEVER, we should not see this as inevitable.

The history of public space should be read alongside the history of
private spaces.  BECAUSE privitisation has had the upper hand in many
historical turns (e.g., in agendas of enclosure and austerity), public
goods of various kinds suffer.  This can be seen not only in attested
public ‘spaces’, but in offerings like council housing, which in
current times is often degraded as well as having decreased
availability.

This history is not unknown, but responses which aim to assert agency
over space often amount to a descent into protest.  The People’s
Republic of Stoke’s Croft is one local history, in which protest is
paired with other forms of activism.  [[https://thebristolcable.org/2021/04/the-stokes-croft-riots-10-years-on-tesco/][Protest]] alone may prove
ineffective at achieving its goals.  THEREFORE, forms of activism that
directly enhance public space should be preferred.

SPECIFICALLY, the iDocumentary methods ([[id:31430561-7338-4b02-8abe-83b651067665][Polyphonic documentary]]) can be
brought into activist settings in a way that gives recognition, builds
awareness, and link stories.

feel friendly to all potential users

:tag: :HL:BP:
:CUSTOM_ID: f83051b3-95b5-4471-b03d-eeeccda51d6d
:END:

** Problem

Informed by [[id:56ce8d31-d3d6-4493-bb41-b07d810afbcc][Causal Layered Analysis]], at the workshop we were ready to
work across levels — but did we have the /correct/ set of levels for the
‘public space & public health’ setting front-of-mind?

** Solution Strategy

Something that came up in the discussions around the workshop and
PLACARD method was our prominent focus on /the wellbeing of
participants/.  We could frame this in a rough analogy with Doughnut
Economics, HOWEVER the framing would be different in this small-scale
format.

BECAUSE ‘health’ is inherently a complex topic — e.g., considering a
“bio-psycho-social” or “bio-psycho-social-eco” model — there are
multiple moving parts.  If we want to talk about health effectively in
future versions of the workshop, we might want to rethink aspects of
the workshop itself using /these/ components; e.g., the “roles” that we
use in Phase II could potentially be rethought this way.

Since we cannot be guaranteed to have teams of participants with expertise evenly
divided along the bio/psycho/social/eco components of health,
THEREFORE, it could be useful to survey some of the other frameworks
that are out there that could be relevant to this reframing, so that
we could get creative about reconfiguring them.  Examples might
include [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manfred_Max-Neef%27s_Fundamental_human_needs][Manfred Max-Neef's Fundamental human needs]], Schwartz’s [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Basic_Human_Values][Theory
of Basic Human Values]].

#+begin_quote
/According to Schwartz, individual values are responses to three
universal requirements of human existence, namely needs of people as
biological organisms, of agreement in social actions, and of survival
and well-being of groups./
#+end_quote

SPECIFICALLY, the axes and dimensions that were used to organise
scenarios (in-balance vs out-of-balance, scarcity, aliveness,
availability of knowledge commons, etc.) provide a very rough
framework that was generated by participants.  How would we analyse
our workshop’s framework in terms of the bio-psycho-social-eco model
of health?  Does it have natural ‘habitable zones’ similar to the Kate
Raworth doughnut?  One limiting factor that was drawn into the diagram
was based on language/access/education.  Since many of our solutions
were related to /communication/, these do seem to be relevant factors.
How do these limiting factors show up around active participation in
(both) [[id:57f06710-a96c-4cbc-bcc7-57d3d3e550c4][Public Space & Public Discourse]]?

** Validation

In the full Bristol workshop, we continued to use the CLA levels, but
we presented them as a set of concentric circles, both in our framing
presentation, and in visual templates that we distributed to
participants (see images below).

#+CAPTION: Our pictoral framing of the workshop design

[[../manual/concentric-grid.jpg]]

This reframing of the suggests an analysis of the layers in this order
of descent:

| Psycho- | Litany    | Observables        |
| Social- | System    | Factors and actors |
| Bio-    | Worldview | Attitudes          |
| Eco-    | Myth      | Shared values      |

*** Further comments unpacking that

It makes sense that /observables/ would be top of mind in our
psychological make-up.  We’re also able to perceive aspects of the
social world, though without reflection, we can be more driven by
immediate sense perceptions than the more complex relations which give
rise to those perceptions.  We also bring many well-documented biases
to our cognition and emotion, based on the long history of human
evolution.  Nevertheless, we are now also aware, at least in the back
of our minds, of ourselves as part of an ecological system
(cf. /Nouvelles du monde/, by Serres).

*** Further links with the design pattern format

The table above can be extended directly to incorporate our four-part
pattern format:

| Psycho- | Litany    | Observables        | /HOWEVER/      |
| Social- | System    | Factors and actors | /BECAUSE/      |
| Bio-    | Worldview | Attitudes          | /THEREFORE/    |
| Eco-    | Myth      | Shared values      | /SPECIFICALLY/ |

Again, some brief remarks to narrate this extension.

/Conflicts/ exist at the observable layer.  They may be well-known
blockers or simply annoyances.

/Causal/ relations are typically derived from social relationships.
Here it may be useful to recall George Mead’s reframing of ‘sociality’
in terms co-evolution or change (which is then reflected in our
awareness).[fn:: George H. Mead, /The philosophy of the present/, Open
Court, 1932.]

# #+begin_quote
# What is peculiar to intelligence is that it is a change that involves
# a mutual reorganization, an adjustment in the organism and a
# reconstitution of the environment; for at its lowest terms any change
# in the organism carries with it a difference of sensitivity and
# response and a corresponding difference in the environment. [...] Now
# what we are accustomed to call social is only a so-called
# consciousness of such a process, but the process is not identical with
# the consciousness of it, for that is an awareness of the situation.
# The social situation must be there if there is to be consciousness of
# it.
# #+end_quote

Our /dispositions/ to action are filtered through our consciousness,
with reference to our existing repertoires of action.

Lastly, although our /values/ are not always top of mind, they are not
ephemeral, but are, rather, among the most concrete things that we
perceive when, to use a tun of phrase, we see with our eyes closed.
Specific actions which are not already-programmed by our existing
/patterns of action/ are likely to relate to these values.  (Here we
could refer to, e.g., Spinoza’s ethics.)

*** More specific relationship to the Raworth doughnut

With these comments in mind, the relationship to the Raworth doughnut
becomes clearer.  ‘Eco’ is at the core of the CLA model, but the
periphery of the Raworth doughnut.  An ‘overshoot’ of the /ecological
ceiling/ corresponds, here, to living a life not in line with our
values, or even more fundamentally to values which underspecified.
Similarly, a ‘shortfall’ relative to /social foundation/ relates to the
underprovision of public goods and to the /fragmentation/ of the
ecosphere in individual minds (often, themselves, fragmented by
craving).  We can do something about this in local communities if we
[[id:0f9e1955-845f-419d-bb55-70051d5df2c3][Rebalance social services]].

This also suggests a strategy for ‘patternizing’ materials from the
workshop.  During the workshop itself, we already began to [[id:6ec29348-55cd-404b-b352-238db7f85b72][Identify
core concepts]].  This gives us a picture of the ‘myth’ layer.  From
there, we should be able to work back to new and possibly quite
different social relationships.

** Problem summary
** Solution summary

We see things as complex and interconnected HOWEVER we also need to make sense of things by teasing apart details.

BECAUSE we have potential for overwhelm if we simply live awash in the
world, we have evolved language tools that work ‘digitally’ to give us
structure and grammar.

We can use these tools at various levels, ranging from language to
written words to digital tools. THEREFORE if we want to make sense of
a complex situation it is useful to have all of these tools at our
disposal.

SPECIFICALLY in the Bristol workshop, we used mind-maps, cards, and
Org Roam to start to digitize the maps.
- Concepts at the ‘Psycho-’ level may be, usefully, related to [[id:59798017-b0af-473e-bdcd-108a8ef1e06d][Productive tensions]], though they will not always start out that way.
- Some of the core concepts will exist at the ‘Bio-’ level, and correspond to [[id:827ae14c-27d3-4483-93a9-d4005c5231a8][Human needs]].
- Some will exist at the ‘Social-’ level, particularly those corresponding to [[id:26ffbc6f-7955-41bd-8c91-99be46847e72][Agency]].
- ‘Eco-’ concepts may be perceived as a conflict, e.g., [[id:9574546b-4e65-4f40-89e0-95bf41b7eb87][People vs. Nature]], however in a more positive story the concepts could relate to people living in harmony with nature.

:END:

** Problem summary

If we take it as given that “Bristol needs to grow” (a debateable
point), then it can either grow intensively with higher-density
housing, or it can grow extensively by building at the boundaries.
Both of these have some associated challenges.  Here we consider
strategies for building at the boundaries.

** Solution summary

This should relate to the ‘Avon Mouth’ discussion, see ‘Group 3 details’. 

This relates to the concept of [[id:4ed30e8c-784a-401e-9631-add816f8c2be][Boundaries]].  It also relates to both
the [[id:86d1669e-bd6c-487b-a8f1-3ca8a211817f][Tension between public/private]], and [[id:9574546b-4e65-4f40-89e0-95bf41b7eb87][People vs. Nature]], insofar as
the ‘edges’ may be (or may be perceived to be) closer to wild space,
and as such may be conceptualised as ‘external’ and ‘public by
default’.
* Remote Facilitation
:PROPERTIES:
:tag: :HL:BF:
:CUSTOM_ID: d718ec87-1ed5-4804-a219-4b9cba2376d9
:END:

For the Bristol Full workshop, we introduced a remote facilitation
circuit.  This wasn’t as effective as we’d hoped, so for now let’s
record the problems that came up, and then think about mitigation
strategies.

Previously, technology had been used asynchronously, to help identify
new patterns in an “offline” analysis; see [[id:20a61286-bc8b-46ed-8dca-21aeef31969a][Bristol Pilot Screenshots]],
for example.

For this workshop, we wanted to try some real-time analysis, which
would reflect what was going on in the room into a org roam repository
and Org Roam UI interface that participants could look at.  This was
something of a stop-gap solution given that the technology+skills
aren’t yet available for participants to easily edit a shared graph in
real time.  (However, this did constitute a ‘pilot’ for such a system,
given that Noorah and Leo were working together as two skilled Org
Roam operators to create the graph!)

Some obstacles could be expected given this set-up.

** Obstacles

*** Lossy communication from photos
Remote facilitators were sent photos of text but didn’t have the
context.  Accordingly, they could start to type up what they saw on
the page but didn’t typically know what what the contents meant.
(E.g., what is "Turbo Island"?)

*** Briefing over lunch did not have quite the desired effect
Joe had some time over lunch to describe what was going on with the
images, but didn’t join the ongoing Org Roam session in progress.  We
might have been more effective if the remote facilitators had
‘interviewed’ the in-person facilitators about outstanding questions,
and recorded their answers into the graph.

*** Participants did not use the chat function, or at least not much
We set up a way for participants to reach the remote facilitators,
using a chat tool rather than a ‘text box’.  Participants perhaps
didn’t see the point, but in any case they didn’t use it much.

** Potential mitigation strategies

*** We could try to replicate the setup for an upcoming ERG meeting so that we take notes directly into a constellation
- Rather than sharing one buffer via CRDT, let’s try to co-edit a constellation so that we get more familiar with the workflow.

*** Other ideas: TBA
