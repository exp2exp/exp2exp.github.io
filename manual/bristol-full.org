* Open Future Design workshop: Introduction

:tag: :HL:WS:
:CUSTOM_ID: b7b42aa2-c57c-4bcc-bc45-be9b63972be7
:END:

** Overview

Our /Open Future Design/ (OFD) workshop is mirrored by a collaboration
method called "PLACARD" that scaffolds social perception, cognition,
and action.[fn:: fullcite:patterns-of-patterns]  PLACARD combines design patterns
with futuring exercises and review processes.  The OFD workshop walks
participants through a cycle of creative learning using these methods,
which they can later reuse on their own.  Our intention with the
workshop is, therefore, primarily to introduce new collaboration
methods and to show how they are effective.

Applications of the method range from building new platforms for
collaborative design and citizen science, to assisting on-the-ground
innovation projects.  In the workshop format, we work from the
assumption that we are talking to groups of people who have not yet
formed a strong group identity, and who are not necessarily all going
to work together on one highly cohesive project, but who are likely to
need to communicate with each other in the future.  We make structural
use of breakout groups and full-group discussions to gather
information at different levels of significance.  We also introduce a
technology-assisted quasi-real-time sensemaking process, which allows
participants to focus on content, while the technology helps to weave
new meanings at the context level.

** Outcomes and Evalution

*** Intermediate artifacts

- Mindmaps created with participants
- Group insights in a form of shared future stories

*** Output

- A constellation of interrelated design patterns outlining potential paths of action, produced by a diverse group of experts based on a collaborative analysis of complex challenges.

*** Outcomes

- Leverage in a complex challenges, based on a shared understanding of the core issues and a well-articulated design strategy.
- Time-savings, a unified action-orientation, and further multi-lateral relationships, as compared with more naive methods such as interviews, discussions, and focus groups.
- Potential next steps may include new communities of practice, and new initiatives (e.g., grant proposals, working groups).

*** Narrative Example

On November 3rd, 2022 we ran a pilot workshop in Bristol with the
theme “Public Space and Public Health”.  This brought together 8
people with varied expertise on these themes for a structured
discussion.  We discussed the theme, and potential scenarios for
development.  We then zoomed in on one of the scenarios, and discussed
its surrounding motivations.  In follow-up analysis, the facilitators
identified new ‘design patterns’ that could enable workshop
participants to solve the problems they identified.  On November 17,
2022, we ran a second pilot with a group of futurists at the
Anticipation conference in Tempe, Arizona, focused on workshopping the
methods.  Following this pilot we reflected on how we could make
better use of the direct particpants’ skills to facilitate broader
uptake beyond the activities in the room.

On January 23, 2023 we ran a longer workshop on a similar theme to the
first pilot: "Public space for public health: a call to action".  This
time, there were approximately twice as many participants, and we had
most of the day together.  We had made several changes to the
structure of the workshop.  In the first session, we used a
multi-stage share-back process to understand layered meanings.  In the
second session, we used manipulatives to elaborate design solutions.
In both phases, participants were accompanied by a remote team that
worked to make sense of data coming from the room.  Each break out
group was additionally supported by one or more persons who had
attended the initial pilot.

*** Limitations

- Interrater reliablity is initially low, though it should improve as our collection of design patterns grows.  For now, have partially addressed this concerned through the multi-layered analysis process, which weaves between small-group, whole-group, and written text.

* Remote Facilitation

:CUSTOM_ID: d718ec87-1ed5-4804-a219-4b9cba2376d9
:END:

For the Bristol Full workshop, we introduced a remote facilitation
circuit.  This wasn’t as effective as we’d hoped, so for now let’s
record the problems that came up, and then think about mitigation
strategies.

Previously, technology had been used asynchronously, to help identify
new patterns in an “offline” analysis; see [[id:20a61286-bc8b-46ed-8dca-21aeef31969a][Bristol Pilot Screenshots]],
for example.

For this workshop, we wanted to try some real-time analysis, which
would reflect what was going on in the room into a org roam repository
and Org Roam UI interface that participants could look at.  This was
something of a stop-gap solution given that the technology+skills
aren’t yet available for participants to easily edit a shared graph in
real time.  (However, this did constitute a ‘pilot’ for such a system,
given that Noorah and Leo were working together as two skilled Org
Roam operators to create the graph!)

Some obstacles could be expected given this set-up.

** Obstacles

*** Lossy communication from photos
Remote facilitators were sent photos of text but didn’t have the
context.  Accordingly, they could start to type up what they saw on
the page but didn’t typically know what what the contents meant.
(E.g., what is "Turbo Island"?)

*** Briefing over lunch did not have quite the desired effect
Joe had some time over lunch to describe what was going on with the
images, but didn’t join the ongoing Org Roam session in progress.  We
might have been more effective if the remote facilitators had
‘interviewed’ the in-person facilitators about outstanding questions,
and recorded their answers into the graph.

*** Participants did not use the chat function, or at least not much
We set up a way for participants to reach the remote facilitators,
using a chat tool rather than a ‘text box’.  Participants perhaps
didn’t see the point, but in any case they didn’t use it much.

** Potential mitigation strategies

*** We could try to replicate the setup for an upcoming ERG meeting so that we take notes directly into a constellation
- Rather than sharing one buffer via CRDT, let’s try to co-edit a constellation so that we get more familiar with the workflow.

*** Other ideas: TBA
