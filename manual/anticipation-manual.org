* Open Future Design workshop: Introduction
:PROPERTIES:
:tag: :HL:WS:
:CUSTOM_ID: b7b42aa2-c57c-4bcc-bc45-be9b63972be7
:END:

** Overview

Our /Open Future Design/ (OFD) workshop is mirrored by a strategy called
"PLACARD" that distributed teams can use to scaffold social
perception, cognition and action.[fn:: fullcite:patterns-of-patterns]  This method
combines design patterns with future scenario planning and review
processes.  The OFD workshop is, essentially, the first run through a
cycle that groups can repeat on their own.  The workshop introduces
new collaboration methods and shows how they are effective.
Applications range from building new platforms for collaborative
design and citizen science, to assisting on-the-ground innovation
projects.

** Outcomes and Evaluation

*** Intermediate artifacts

- Mindmaps created with participants.
- Group insights, in the form of shared futures.

*** Output

- A constellation of interrelated design patterns that is produced by a diverse group of experts, based on shared futures.

*** Outcomes

- Long-term community engagement and buy-in based on agreed upon design patterns.
- Time-savings, unified structure, and further multilateral relationships formed (improving upon the standard default of individual meetings with stakeholders).
- Potential next steps include new communities of practice, and new initiatives (e.g., grant proposals, working groups).

*** Limitations

- Interrater reliability is initially low, though this may improve as
  our collection of design patterns grows.

*** Narrative Example

On November 17rd, 2022 we ran a pilot in Mesa, AZ with the theme
"Going Meta, Anticipating Anticipation".  This brought together 10
people with varied expertise on these themes for a structured
discussion.  In the first phase, we discussed the theme, and potential
scenarios for development (...).  We then zoomed in on a couple of
these scenarios in separate and fleshed them out in small groups
(...).  Then followed a share-back round in which the two groups could
listen to one another (...) In a follow-up round of analysis, the
facilitators looked at notes from the workshop and found new ‘design
patterns’ that enable workshop participants to solve the problems they
identified.  (Details follow.)

* Sharing our stories
:PROPERTIES:
:tag: :HL:BP:
:CUSTOM_ID: ab96ee6b-86f2-4b0d-a3b5-3654864644b3
:END:

** Problem

We only had a relatively small amount of time during the pilot.

** Solution Strategy

One of the proposals that we talked about was a “Listening project
2.0” HOWEVER we only had time to go in depth into one person’s
personal history during our workshop.

BECAUSE of limitations of the workshop, as to time and scale, getting
even one story written down is an achievement !  Nevertheless, we all
might have stories somewhat similar to Judith’s (with plenty
differences as well) about how we got interested in the things we are
now doing professionally.  If we were to share these stories we’d have
completed a solid get-to-know-you round, and might then have an even
better ‘springboard’ for further dialogue.

THEREFORE, we could develop a small-scale pilot of our “Listening
Project 2.0” that follows Judith’s example and each tell some story
about how we got into the work we are doing now.  The original
Listening Project is itself [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Listening_Project][well documented]], and we could borrow some
of their ideas.  This might then put us in a good position to return
to the roles from the workshop, with various attendees sitting in the
“[[id:57d46961-a056-435e-85d2-27ab6e0de7f6][Historian]]” seat, and others taking on the other roles to think about
how their work might relate to the trajectory traced by each
Historian.

SPECIFICALLY, we might do the initial information gathering in a series
of online interviews with attendees, circulate the materials, and then
return to a suitable space for group dialogue.
* Measures of complexity as indicative of health
:PROPERTIES:
:tag: :HL:BP:
:CUSTOM_ID: a80f0651-a681-4c9a-b398-9e66e1cdfb71
:END:

** Problem

We envisioned healthy public spaces as complex and multi-use but
didn’t (yet) have related tangible measures that could give us direct
feedback on urban health.

** Solution Strategy

In various examples, we talked about public spaces as multi-use or
transformable.  For example, a cycle path has different properties at
rush hour and other times of day.  From a traditional design pattern
standpoint, design is useful for minimising conflict.  (E.g., bike
lanes might be installed in the first place following a pattern like
"Build protected bike lanes where motor vehicle speed consistently
exceeds 25 mph.")  HOWEVER, sometimes the multiple uses are going to
be in conflict, or the design solution itself will create new
conflicts (e.g., a four-lane bicycle highway might help with speed
issues — but it would have a bigger environmental footprint and a
two-lane path).  Sometimes the multiple uses are inconsistent (e.g., a
given space cannot straightforwardly be both a football pitch and a
hill).  A metaphor that we used in our discussion was that the city’s
structure should be “like organs” and “not mushed up”.  (A similar
body metaphor was used to describe the design of Paris’s sewer
system!)

BECAUSE we are thinking in terms of ‘health’ we may want to switch
from ‘minimising conflict’ to ‘increasing complexity’ as our overall
goal.  Natural systems may contain lots of conflict (e.g., between the
wishes of wildebeests and lions) and still be complex and vital.  A
eutrophic pond reduces conflict by creating the conditions for a
monoculture of algae: that’s probably not what we want.  Maybe even
more specifically we want patterns “at the edge of chaos”, which
exhibit both organisation and instability (cf. the [[http://www.interactivearchitecture.org][Interactive
Architecture]] lab at UCL — they might be worth talking to as part of an
interactive-everything consortium).

THEREFORE, let’s look around for some design principles that take the
“edge of chaos” into account.  Here are some ideas from [[https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-edge-peak-performance-psychology/202007/the-edge-chaos][Psychology
Today]], drawing models of elite performance.  Here is a [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3766553/][paper]] that
draws on the edge-of-chaos concept to critique applications of
‘sustainability’.  Doyne Farmer, who coined the term, is now at the
Oxford Martin school, and has contributed to a 1988 [[https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.1201/9780429492846-6/new-approaches-nonlinear-modeling-improve-economic-forecasts-doyne-farmer-john-sidorowich][volume]] on ‘The
Economy As An Evolving Complex System’.  How has this thinking been
taken up since then?  Note that there are various approaches to
measuring urban health which aren’t specifically informed by
complexity theory, but which could be brought into a new
complexity-informed synthesis:

#+begin_quote
In the 1960s, a social indicator movement flourished in the United
States: agencies ranging from the USDA to NASA advocated for a
national social accounting body, cities regularly published
data-driven reports on urban wellbeing, and academics assembled
comprehensive social progress indices for cities, counties, and
states. — [[https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/118070?show=full][Making urban progress legible : the role of territorial social indicators in the new economy]] by Sarah Oz Johnson, 2018
#+end_quote

SPECIFICALLY, Farmer has worked on [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05277][agent simulations]] in recent years.
This is something we looked into in an adjacent effort.  How might we
revive the central ideas within future interactive experiments?  Would
this relate to what we might do within an "[[https://www.domesday86.com/?page_id=149][Ecodisc]] 2.0" type of
project, perhaps rethought as an interactive game-based platform
(e.g., here thinking of SimEarth or SimCity).

#+begin_quote
("The BBC Ecodisc offers a unique opportunity to manage a real nature
reserve at your desk. The project which was 2 years in the making
includes 4000 photographs, 150 video sequences and over 1000 kilobytes
of software. It is about a real nature reserve at Slapton Ley in
Devon, you have the opportunity to explore the reserve and its
inhabitants and to manage it.")
#+end_quote

Might we want to connect future experiments with other local
experiments like the [[https://bristolpound.org/][Bristol Pound]], perhaps making an "Ecodisc of
Bristol’s Urban Ecosystem"?  (Any such team up would depend on how 
[[https://web.archive.org/web/20211007151020/https://bristolpound.org/future-vision/][their plans]] are developing.)

All of this is relevant to thinking about how we move forward [[id:3d0acf49-0c87-4aaa-94b3-84e5d926d58d][After
the workshop]], and what might distinguish our approach to [[id:2b1ca06d-486e-4398-a2c9-a4a9e303eaa3][Community
Tech]] from a generic communication platform.
* (Inter-)Personal Doughnut

:END:

** Problem

Informed by [[id:56ce8d31-d3d6-4493-bb41-b07d810afbcc][Causal Layered Analysis]], at the workshop we were ready to
work across levels — but did we have the correct set of levels for the
‘public space & public health’ setting front-of-mind?

** Solution Strategy

Something that came up in the discussions around the workshop and
PLACARD method was our prominent focus on the wellbeing of
participants.  We could frame this in a rough analogy with Doughnut
Economics, HOWEVER the framing would be different in this small-scale
format.

BECAUSE ‘health’ is inherently a complex topic — e.g., considering a
“bio-psycho-social” or “bio-psycho-social-eco” model — there are
multiple moving parts.  If we want to talk about health effectively in
future versions of the workshop, we might want to rethink aspects of
the workshop itself using these components, e.g., the "roles" that we
introduced could be rethought this way.

Since we cannot be guaranteed to have teams of participants evenly
divided along the bio/psycho/social/eco components of health,
THEREFORE, it could be useful to survey some of the other frameworks
that are out there that could be relevant to this reframing, so that
we could get creative about reconfiguring them.  Examples might
include [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manfred_Max-Neef%27s_Fundamental_human_needs][Manfred Max-Neef's Fundamental human needs]], Schwartz’s [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Basic_Human_Values][Theory
of Basic Human Values]].

#+begin_quote
/According to Schwartz, individual values are responses to three
universal requirements of human existence, namely needs of people as
biological organisms, of agreement in social actions, and of survival
and well-being of groups./
#+end_quote

SPECIFICALLY, the axes and dimensions that were used to organise
scenarios (in-balance vs out-of-balance, scarcity, aliveness,
availability of knowledge commons, etc.) provide a very rough
framework that was generated by participants.  How would we analyse
our workshop’s framework in terms of the bio-psycho-social-eco model
of health?  Does it have natural ‘habitable zones’ similar to the Kate
Raworth doughnut?  One limiting factor that was drawn into the diagram
was based on language/access/education.  Since many of our solutions
were related to /communication/, these do seem to be relevant factors.
How do these limiting factors show up around active participation in
(both) [[id:57f06710-a96c-4cbc-bcc7-57d3d3e550c4][Public Space & Public Discourse]]?
* Public Space & Public Discourse
:PROPERTIES:
:tag: :HL:BP:
:CUSTOM_ID: 57f06710-a96c-4cbc-bcc7-57d3d3e550c4
:END:

** Problem

The theme of the workshop was “public space for public health”, but our discussion was more noticeably a small-scale model of ‘public discourse’.  How could we develop that model further?

** Solution Strategy

The workshop’s theme was ‘public space for public health’, HOWEVER the
most noticeable theme that surfaced in the second part of the workshop
was the relationship of these topics to ‘public discourse’.

BECAUSE public discourse can ‘take place’ within both physical and
virtual settings, this adds another virtual dimension to our thinking.
Some of the most tangible proposals combined space, health, and
discourse.  The workshop itself took place in person, and gave us
the opportunity to practice some of the ideas we were discussing.

We don’t want to [[https://peeragogy.org/reduce_reuse_recycle][reinvent the wheel]], THEREFORE it would be useful to
look at existing systems working at this intersection.  One example is
[[https://www.bigissue.com/][The Big Issue]], "The UK's number one street paper and social
enterprise, giving people who are experiencing homelessness or who are
vulnerably housed a hand up."  People selling the paper physically
occupy public spaces such as street corners, and promote discourse
around a range of topics, including, e.g., [[https://www.bigissue.com/news/environment/why-englands-rivers-are-so-polluted-and-will-be-for-years-to-come/][environmental concerns]].
That said, some aspects of the paper’s production and model and
business model aren’t obvious at first look (e.g., who writes it? what
percentage of the sales go to distribution, production, and admin?).
It may also be interesting to draw some ideas from the ‘open’
ecosystem when designing new solutions in this space.

SPECIFICALLY, the Big Issue is useful as an example of the idea 
of *transformable space* that was discussed in the workshop: street corners
become places of work, as well as information depots.  The “Listening Project
2.0” and “Ecodisc 2.0/Facilitated Dialogue/Doughnut Deals” scenarios
that we discussed could potentially dovetail with the Big Issue’s
existing distribution model, as sources of production.  Other models
could be possible: if homeless people can find fruitful employment in
distribution, could they also be employed, e.g., as a documentary film
crew?  We might also use some of these ideas to change how we do
[[id:781d52fa-71a9-4c90-b4f6-9b0dd4244c33][Workshop backstage organisation]] and [[id:2a01f142-31c7-4e86-ae10-e14e85b4dda9][Workshop frontstage organisation]] in the future,
keeping in mind that the workshop itself is a “transformable space”—and, hopefully, also a
space for transformation.  As a simple example, building on our connection
with iDocs, what would the workshop look like if we gave people
the opportunity to take some pictures during the break?  Could we use
these images as illustrations of the scenarios, and develop them into
design pattern templates, like the https://hyperreal.enterprises/open-futures patterns?
