\noindent This document collects the notes taken at the first 50 sessions of the Emacs Research Group’s seminars. Notes were taken by attendees with the Emacs editor, using the \texttt{crdt} package for real-time collaborative editing.  Along with these notes, the document includes a discussion of our patterns identified in these meetings, and example service-delivery roadmap based on these patterns.</span></p><p><span>Some of our patterns of working can be perceived in the detailed
section outline for ERG sessions.  Recent meetings are kept to 1½
hours, with a consistent signature:
\begin{itemize*}
\item[] Check-in
\item[$\rightarrow$] Meta points
\item[$\rightarrow$] Agenda Part 1
\item[$\rightarrow$] Break
\item[$\rightarrow$] Agenda Part 2
\item[$\rightarrow$] Project Action Review (PAR)
\item[$\rightarrow$] Tentative agenda for next week
\item[$\rightarrow$] Check-out.
\end{itemize*}
Often our sessions feel like a “Writer’s Room” for a TV series; as such we’ve referred to each year of work as a ‘Season’.</span></p><p><span>One of the key points of our efforts to date is to look for ways to make our methods shareable.  Our \href{https://emacsconf.org/2021/talks/erg/}{talk for EmacsConf 2021} provided a compressed summary, and our preprint “\href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10497}{Patterns of Patterns}” elaborates on that at length.  Our current aims are to:
\begin{itemize}
\item expand our working methods into an interactive workshop for rapid-problem solving; and,
\item to develop an wiki that encapsulates a slower-changing but nonetheless dynamic and remixable record of information generated in these sessions.
\end{itemize}</span></p><p><span>Our seminars serve as mini-pilots for the workshop, and our notes constitute an early prototype of the wiki.</span></p><p><span>Some of the scenarios we are interested in exploring in this and future seasons include: \emph{The Integration of Design Patterns and Active Inference}, \emph{The Future of Free Software and Citizen Science}, and \emph{Climate Adaptation}.  We plan to do this with guest attendees, in a mixture of convivial \emph{pro bono} discussions and paid consulting contracts.

This helps us
reflect on what we did during the meeting, and sometimes allows us to
formulate perspectives that weren’t surfaced during the meeting.  More recently,
we realised that the first question of the Project Action Review
(“Review the intention: what do we expect to learn or make together?”)
should be engaged with as a meta-point, early in the session.  Broadly
the PAR helps us cultivate a sense of shared mindfulness about what
we’re doing.</span></p><p><span>\medskip

complex understanding of ‘patterns’.  Our methods allow us to
establish a high-level view for surfacing patterns.  We also
understand ‘patterns’ as not always complete: they can also be
‘projects’.  Design patterns have an orientation towards scaffolding
action!  The distilled data from logged </span><a href="#*-meeting-review"></a><span> and [[* Meeting
meta-review]] can help us notice relevant patterns.</span></p><p><span>A collection of patterns can then become a quite general system for
information and workflow management.  As our collaborator Abby Tabor
summarises the motivations for establishing a link between design
patterns and the theory of Active Inference:</span></p><p><span>\begin{quote}\emph{“Each problem-system will be described as a pattern, setting out the evidence and hypothesis for resolution.  Each pattern is itself evolving over time, shaped by new findings; contextual, specific to the problem at hand, evidence-based and related to other patterns; and communicable, both teaching and learning for users of multiple disciplines.”}

E.g., we’re planning to deploy some body-led methods at the Bristol workshop, maybe we could build some understanding of those methods before the day of the workshop (e.g., Joe could drop down to London again and do a meeting that includes Claire some Saturday).</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><h4 class="firn-headline firn-headline-4" id="write-up"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Write-up</span></span></h4><section><p><span>We can get a head start on this by collecting PARs throughout the eproject (</span><strong><span>Meeting review</span></strong><span> </span><a href="#*-meeting-review"></a><span>) and developing a CLA based on these (</span><strong><span>Meeting meta-review</span></strong><span> </span><a href="#*-meeting-meta-review"></a><span>).</span></p><p><span>\medskip

Thinking about </span><em><span>the research process in general</span></em><span>.  I’ve come to this
collection of tools having filtered through a wide variety of options.
But the whole while I’ve been focused on research itself, not the
specific toolset.</span></p><p><span>So, I’d be motivated if we agree the prioritisation is ‘what does it
mean to do things like take notes & how can we do it in ways that help
us realise our interests?’.</span></p><p><span>I like to ask questions I don’t know the answer to.  I plan to engage
in this, but sometimes it feels like a waste of time.  You can</span><em><span>characaturise</span></em><span> taking notes: transcribing the world’s knowledge at a
snail’s pace!  You’ll never cover a useful fraction!</span></p><p><span>But what we’re doing is trying to augment our memory.  It slows us
down in reading, but likelihood that we’d remember is low.</span></p><p><span>So, there’s some co-optimisation... what we write down & what we
choose to ignore... evolves over the lifetime of anyone (and any
researcher in particular).</span></p><p><span>At the same time I believe in combining these philosophical things w/
very down-to-earth things.</span></p><p><span>What we functionally have is, Joe taking a note in a place where we
don’t all have access.  We </span><strong><span>could</span></strong><span> immediately solve this by opening a
Google Doc. This is why people don’t use these tools.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>RSP: Just transcribing doesn’t work well; usually the purpose of notes is to make a roadmap.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Literary example: Borges’s map vs an actual </span><strong><span>roadmap</span></strong><span> for the knowledge you have</span></p></li></ul></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-6"><h6 class="firn-headline firn-headline-6" id="lv:-there’s-a-fundamental-aspect-of-ethics"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>LV: There’s a fundamental aspect of ethics</span></span></h6><section><ul><li><p><span>What we have here is free software, that allowed us to do research

been highlighting financing work on Emacs</span></p></li><li><p><span>Right now he’s aware of planning to write free software but needs to think of a system that allows him to keep doing this</span></p></li><li><p><span>Had highlighted milestone-based plans (e.g., get transclusion into Org Roam with money on the table)</span></p><ul><li><p><span>But this was linked to Org Roam, and Leo’s also an Org Mode developer (e.g., org agenda, tasks: not in core Emacs)</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>So what could be interesting is to try to move to a position that affects all of Org Mode</span></p></li><li><p><span>a position of mediation between MELPA packages and Org Mode...</span></p></li><li><p><span>E.g., alphapapa (Adam): </span><code>org-ql</code><span>, </span><code>org-super-agenda</code><span> — but he doesn’t want to merge this stuff into core b/c of bureaucracy</span></p><ul><li><p><span>It’s not an ideological difference, just a matter of overcoming the inconveniences</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><code>org-noter</code><span> and </span><code>pdf-tools</code><span> are presently abandoned: and we might even have trouble getting Copyright for FSF</span></p></li><li><p><span>There are many pockets of interested users around; Org Roam w/ 3K stars on github is just one</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Transclusions, backlinks and so on could go into Org Mode</span></p></li><li><p><span>But rather than having just the Org Roam crowd this would address the whole Org Mode crowd</span></p></li><li><p><span>ORB is an example (which connects different packages)</span></p></li><li><p><span>But Org Super Agenda isn’t presently connected</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>There are plenty of people, e.g., a maths department wanting a Jupyter to org exporter; maybe not reaching the corporate crowd like Magit but still there are people there</span></p></li><li><p><span>Thinking about taxes and fees reached €17K figure for 6 months of work, with stretch goals (like doing a year of work).</span></p></li><li><p><span>Developer, leader, good at talking with people...</span></p></li></ul></section><div

We’ve had interesting and varied guests, and some developing plans for the quarter ahead.  We’ve got a workflow with careful review and diagnosis of issues when expectations aren’t met.  Our work needs to be public first before we can embark on the next phase of this project — which is to mesh with ongoing related activities elsewhere.</span></p><p><span>If we tackle big enough projects, it will bring with it the need for collaboration (who, what is the itinerary; having places to talk about research?).  While we like to create tangible deliverables (e.g., journal articles, rather than half-baked/half-finished publications), “If we knew what the outcome was it wouldn’t be research” — and we want to keep a role for </span><em><span>serendipity</span></em><span> in our work. (Good to have some people holding the fort; we’re doing fine in terms of turn-out at weekly meetings!)</span></p><p><span>We have looked at RStudio as a model of (some of) the
kinds of things we want to do (would be great if we got
it up and running in a year... but this is a lot to ask).
‘Practice’ and ‘method’ keep coming up (respectively,
more bottom up and more top down ways of actualising what
we’re doing; focusing on what we’re actually doing, and
when we’re clear on that, we look at which settings are
the most conducive). E.g., one </span><em><span>method</span></em><span> would be: instead
of having a shared Org Roam directory, having ways of
managing sharing of notes across ‘graphs’. (Collaborative
work, academia, writing a book; have we seen </span><em><span>ORCiD.</span></em><span> If we
all had our slipboxes on there we. Finding these things
which are continually evolving. A Tinder for academics to
match people based on interest... Instead of paying money to go to conferences!  Now we can spontaneously make up conferences. $750.0)</span></p><p><span>What gives an objective character to what we’re doing?  (Noting also that time is going by; things that were timely 7 years ago might not be timely now; the actual relevance goes down.)  Or, rather: what is it that allows us to synthesise new relationships?  What big or ‘existential’ problem are we solving... we’re not pushing ourselves beyond what’s humanly possible, but we are pushing ourselves to learn.</span></p></blockquote><ul><li><p><span>If we had a shared document what would the audience look like?</span></p></li><li><p><span>Does this represent what we think?</span></p><ul><li><p><span>LV: JC’s ‘From the top’ really gave me conservatory PTSD</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>Maybe the chief issue in crossing disciplines is </span><em><span>vocabulary</span></em></p></li><li><p><span>Cross-disciplinary languages?</span></p><ul><li><p><span>How can I sit and absorb this language! — It involves being uncomfortable in new situations and being ready to be uncomfortable in these situations...</span></p></li><li><p><span>This relates to what we’re doing</span></p></li><li><p><span>When LV was talking about fuzzy-matching problems in SX for solutions; maybe we could have a similar approach to bridging the transdisciplinary gaps</span></p></li><li><p><span>JC related this to the fruitful relationship between Deleuze & Guattari</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>Similar to Hyperreal with their ‘four-handed’ method now 8 or 16 handed workflows</span></p></li><li><p><span>The rôle of indices, and their relationship to the slip-box method</span></p></li><li><p><span>Links to explore; possible people to work with?</span></p><ul><li><p><a class="firn-external" href="https://github.com/delaray" target="_blank">delaray (Pierre de Lacaze) · GitHub</a></p></li><li><p><a class="firn-external" href="https://github.com/delaray/babar" target="_blank">GitHub - delaray/babar: Babar is an independent research project in the field of Artificial Intelligence.

Requires some hygiene.  But if this is something people care about and that people use... then it is within the realm of what people use, it’s a way of going from the individual to the collective, that’s technologically backed, and also rewarding.</span></p><p><span>The issue of ‘permissions’ is important, this is why I brought up Orcid — you’d have a permanent ID, and you could give permission to share the things.  This is where 1+1=3...!</span></p><p><span>An easy step would be starting with people who you actually know — the ‘outreach’ could come after ‘output’ phase.</span></p><p><span>Permissions and attracting other people reminds Ray of what we had going on PlanetMath...</span></p><p><span>Now that other people have been pushing in this area, PlanetMath ideas are still relevant (to other people?) — maybe reinvesting some of the ‘soul’ of PlanetMath...</span></p><p><span>But also the PlanetMath community, philosophy, how we met in the first place.</span></p><p><span>LV: Less interested in “how to create something for others to see” — leave outreachu to communities like Reddit or something like this?</span></p><ul><li><p><span>We do have abilities to do R, elisp, and so on...</span></p></li><li><p><span>This is a huge difference from the way things were in October, when we were trying to do all the things that we aren’t trying to do now.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Leo: I’ve been influencing the direction of where this has been going b/c I’ve been thinking about trying to make a living doing this stuff, mapping this space of new skills... now maybe the need for a ‘research project’ or an ‘output’ has been tabled rather than erased.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Now we’re looking for enablement...</span></p></li></ul><p><span>Rather than saying that we lost track of outputs, we’re now a little more rational about what we can achieve; we’ve been discussing in a way that’s productive; the fact that we’re still there is a long/dense track record and we’re still feeling inspired.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>LV: probably wouldn’t be heading into the crowdfunding campaign...</span></p></li></ul><p><span>With these kinds of ‘backup’ ops we start with the real needs that people have (e.g., Leo’s crowdfunding campaign, Ray and Cameron’s coding needs, Noorah’s thesis writing)</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="emacsconf-use-case"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>EmacsConf use case</span></span></h3><section><p><span>We had all the videos split out; we are also able to extract time codes from BBB chat. I can write "Whoops, -5".  There’s a tag, so that 2 hours after the recording has been done with BBB we can slice the video and release it to the public.  With what we’re doing with the ERG meetings, if we were to assume a kind of back-office role, we could have those meetings then OPEN.  The first part being the chat, the second part being the research progress on topics.  If ERG was going to take a role where were expert users, there would be a lot of value of publishing the recordings... both for Leo, and for someone who is in the spotlight in the community.  The symbiotic..</span></p><p><span>Ray has been typing into Logseq while we are going, there’s a little project to improve it...</span></p><p><span>For Noorah, I do get a lot out of these meetings as a way to think about things, from a shelfish perspective it’s a place to take a break from my research!  And to switch to something else that I enjoy!  I don’t know how to materialise it: I am interested in building the system, collaborative networks, collaborative processes, that’s something I’m very interested in.  And Emacs is a great place to prototype ideas.</span></p><p><span>Keeping things based on impact and output. We struck a nice balance w/ input/output; also had a lot of high-level discussions about what collaboration in Org Roam would be.</span></p><p><span>Now it feels like we could back to having people over, as we did before!  Based on what David and Noorah did, we may need to implement an idea of co-development / co-creation that’s more grounded into the practical stuff.  Trying to figure out how we bring to life the collaborative slip box.</span></p><p><span>If in 2 months I’m financed with my kickstarter, I can see how much work I can put into this.  If we had a tag-up meeting that we can try out, just having this pattern of actualising the vision that we’ve been discussing...</span></p><p><span>Maybe the tension has been the high-level & the practical</span></p><p><span>RSP: I’m very interested in the things you’re saying about Org Roam; right now I’m using the tools I have, but later this year I’ll be working on the hypernotebooks.  Right now I’m busy getting the math and physics done, but later this year planning to be getting back to programming and setting up the computer and so on. If I hear a little bit every week I have time to let it sink in, and prepare for when I do get back to it.</span></p><p><span>So, not an idea of moving 80% to practical stuff, but having a slow-cooking thing.  It might not be serendipity if we’re intending — maybe it’s a metal detector — but if we try using the software and looking for improvement, we can share it on YouTube ... it can connect people.  This is probably the right way to do it</span></p><p><span>Mini Emacs-Rocks?</span></p><p><span>5 minute lightning talks?</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="crdt-feature-requests"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>crdt feature-requests</span></span></h3><section><ul><li><p><span>Ways to act on the view-port</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Asking for focus</span></p></li><li><p><span>Keybinding that can switch us to the next person</span></p></li><li><p><span>instead of having to switch to the buffer</span></p></li><li><p><span>Modeline indicator</span></p></li></ul></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="rel-with-ogm"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>rel. with OGM</span></span></h3><section><ul><li><p><span>OGMConf?</span></p></li><li><p><span>Fee?</span></p></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="org-roam-feature-requests"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>org-roam feature-requests</span></span></h3><section><ul><li><p><span>collaborative slip-boes & org-roam-server</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Thinking with intersections / Venn diagrams</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>Test-driven, relate to implementations, relate to other</span></p></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="par"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>PAR</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#10m">10m</a></span></span></h3><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-5"><h5 class="firn-headline firn-headline-5" id="1-review-the-intention:-what-do-we-expect-to-learn-or-make-together?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>1.

run commands.

You can’t be part of the group unless you know the words that are used.  And this explains how things can become less diverse.</span></p></li><li><p><span>RSP: And you can then ask why that is the case.  E.g., we have the term ‘buffer’ so that’s important?  Or, that’s purely a historical accident and it excludes people who would otherwise be part of the discussion.</span></p></li><li><p><span>NA: So, the way I was thinking about it — remember the high school kid who presented at EmacsConf...

on/in/with Emacs back in October 2020.</span></p><p><span>We’ve met almost every week since then, and interviewed some
interesting and varied guests. We have a clearer idea of what what we
want to talk about at the next EmacsConf, and how we can be of service
to researchers and Emacs users. We have been using a workflow that
helps us carefully review progress and diagnose issues. The next phase
of this project is to “go public” and mesh with ongoing related
activities elsewhere.</span></p><p><span>If we tackle big enough projects, it will bring with it the need for
collaboration. We like to create tangible deliverables (e.g., journal
articles). However, “If we knew what the outcome was it wouldn’t be
research” — therefore, we’re focusing initially on research methods
and design documents. That may mean it takes us a bit longer to write
our first paper, but when we get something out it will be
good. Meanwhile we’re also keeping sharp by fixing bugs, filing
issues, improving our own workflows, and actively exploring the
landscape. We want to keep a role for serendipity here, which adds the
requirement that our planning process remain open and flexible:
including to various disciplinary methods, and especially to change as
we reflect on how things are going.</span></p><p><span>We have looked at RStudio and Roam Research as models of (some of) the
kinds of things we think Emacs can eventually improve upon. ‘Practice’
and ‘method’ keep coming up in our discussions as, respectively, ‘more
bottom up’ and ‘more top down’ ways of actualising things. Concretely,
we’ve been studying our own processes and looking for the tools and
settings that are the most conducive to the work we want to do. For
example, instead of having a single Org Roam directory shared via Git,
what if we had ways of managing sharing of notes across ‘graphs’?</span></p><p><span>Collaboration is familiar to in all kinds of teams across all
sectors. Even authors working alone may have need to ‘virtually
collaborate with themselves’ — and of course to share their work with
others when it’s ready. If we all had our slipboxes online, we could
reference between them. This would generalise ORCiD, and people to
reference processes that are undergoing evolution. Maybe a service
like this would turn into a ‘Tinder for academics’ — helping to match
people based on their interests (or similar people in different
fields). So, what’s the price point? Instead of paying money to go to
conferences, now we can spontaneously make conferences and
workshops. As a guess, $750.0 per user per year might be a fair price
— for those who can afford to pay it — if the service helps people to
do better research and saves a bunch of travel. We could also set up a
pricing model proportional to each country’s carbon emissions or
something like that.</span></p><p><span>In our concrete methods, we have aligned ourselves with the ‘long-term
perspective’. This includes both retrospective and prospective
thinking. For example, the things that were timely 7 years ago might
not be so timely now; in many the relevance of a given innovation goes
down over time. However, Emacs has an evolutionary character that has
allowed it to keep up with the times — becoming more relevant and
useful ever since Steele and Stallman started to systematise Editor
MACroS for the Text Editor and Corrector (TECO). Not only has the
technology evolved, but so has the social setting in which this work
is done. Whereas the concepts underlying the free software movement
were based on “communal sharing” of source code, with due reflection
these methods extend much more broadly, and allow us to synthesise new
relationships within ecological, semiotic, and genetic commons. Much
like the Universal Turing Machine is a system for modelling any
machine, Emacs can become a system for addresssing any ‘existential’
problem. This does not yet push us beyond what’s humanly possible, but
may expand the frontier of possibility.</span></p></blockquote></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="par"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>PAR</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#4m">4m</a></span></span></h3><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-5"><h5 class="firn-headline firn-headline-5" id="1-review-the-intention:-what-do-we-expect-to-learn-or-make-together?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>1.

Emerging issues analysis, for example, at one level predicts issues
outside of conventional knowledge categories but it does so by
disturbing conventional categories, by making them problematic; it
reorders knowledge.  For example, the notion of the "rights of robots"
forces us to rethink rights, seeing them not as universal but as
historical and political, as hard fought political and conceptual
battles.  It also forces us to rethink intelligence and sentience —
posing the question what is life?  Thus, a futures method such as
emerging issues analysis, conventionally used to identify trends and
problems in their emergent phase, should not merely be seen as a
predictive method; it can also be a critical one.</span></p></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><h4 class="firn-headline firn-headline-4" id="hypothesis"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Hypothes.is</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#15m">15m</a></span></span></h4><section><p><span>We looked at some of the comments on the web page:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>/What makes emacs a framework if it's essentially a tool?

on/in/with Emacs back in October 2020.</span></p><p><span>We’ve met almost every week since then, and interviewed some
interesting and varied guests. We have a clearer idea of what we
want to talk about at the next EmacsConf, and how we can be of service
to researchers and Emacs users. We have been using a workflow that
helps us carefully review progress and diagnose issues. The next phase
of this project is to “go public” and mesh with ongoing related
activities elsewhere.</span></p><p><span>If we tackle big enough projects, it will bring with it the need for
collaboration. We like to create tangible deliverables (e.g., journal
articles). However, “If we knew what the outcome was it wouldn’t be
research” — therefore, we’re focusing initially on research methods
and design documents.  That may mean it takes us a bit longer to write
our first paper, but when we get something out it will be
good.  Meanwhile we’re also keeping sharp by fixing bugs, filing
issues, improving our own workflows, and actively exploring the
landscape.  We want to keep a role for serendipity here, which adds the
requirement that our planning process remain open and flexible:
including to various disciplinary methods, and especially to change as
we reflect on how things are going.</span></p><p><span>We have looked at RStudio and Roam Research as models of (some of) the
kinds of things we think Emacs can eventually improve upon.  ‘Practice’
and ‘method’ keep coming up in our discussions as, respectively, ‘more
bottom up’ and ‘more top down’ ways of actualising things.  Concretely,
we’ve been studying our own processes and looking for the tools and
settings that are the most conducive to the work we want to do.  For
example, instead of having a single Org Roam directory shared via Git,
what if we had ways of managing sharing of notes across ‘graphs’?</span></p><p><span>Collaboration is familiar to all kinds of teams across all
sectors. Even authors working alone may have need to ‘virtually
collaborate with themselves’ — and of course to share their work with
others when it’s ready. If we all had our slipboxes online, we could
reference between them. This would generalise ORCiD, allowing people to
reference processes that are undergoing evolution. Maybe a service
like this could turn into a ‘Tinder for academics’ — helping to match
people based on their interests (or similar people in different
fields). So, what’s the price point? Instead of paying money to go to
conferences, now we can spontaneously make conferences and
workshops. As a guess, $750.00 per user per year might be a fair price
— for those who can afford to pay it — if the service helps people to
do better research and saves a bunch of travel. We could also set up a
pricing model proportional to each country’s carbon emissions or
something like that.</span></p><p><span>In our concrete methods, we have aligned ourselves with the ‘long-term
perspective’. This includes both retrospective and prospective
thinking. For example, the things that were timely 7 years ago might
not be so timely now; in many cases, the relevance of a given innovation goes
down over time. However, Emacs has an </span><em><span>evolutionary</span></em><span> character that has
allowed it to keep up with the times — becoming more relevant and
useful ever since Steele and Stallman started to systematise Editor
MACroS for the Text Editor and Corrector (TECO) program.  Not only has the
technology evolved, but so has the social setting in which this work
is done.  Whereas the concepts underlying the free software movement
were based on “communal sharing” of source code, with due reflection
these methods extend much more broadly, and allow us to synthesise new
relationships within ecological, semiotic, and genetic commons.  Much
like the Universal Turing Machine is a system for modelling any
machine, Emacs can become a system for addressing broad classes of problems.
This does not yet push us beyond what’s humanly possible, but
may expand the frontier of possibility.</span></p></blockquote><ul><li><p><span>LV: More inclined to see the paragraph before this as clearly resolved...</span></p></li></ul></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="par"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>PAR</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#15m">15m</a></span></span></h3><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-5"><h5 class="firn-headline firn-headline-5" id="1-review-the-intention:-what-do-we-expect-to-learn-or-make-together?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>1.

So I could benefit from group discussions rather than going ahead.</span></p></li><li><p><span>RP: An interesting question is, how does Emacs fit with the other platforms (RStudio, Logseq).  Would we want a "Logseq mode"?  Taking Org stuff and detaching it so it could interoperate with other languages/platforms.  This relates closely to Hypernotebooks, because one of the main ideas there was that things would be written/interact with programs outside of Emacs.  Basically "How does Emacs fit with the outside world".

on/in/with Emacs</span></strong><span> back in December 2020.  We’ve met almost every week
since then, and interviewed some interesting and varied guests.  We
have a clearer idea of what we want to talk about at the next
EmacsConf, and how we can be of service to researchers and Emacs
users.  We have been using a workflow that helps us carefully review
progress, diagnose issues, and manage our energy.  The next phase of
this project is to “go public” and mesh with ongoing related
activities elsewhere, including by getting some training events up and
running.</span></p><p><span>If we tackle big enough projects, it will bring with it the need for
collaboration.  We like to create tangible deliverables (e.g. journal
articles). However, “If we knew what the outcome was, it wouldn’t be
research”—therefore, we’re focusing initially on research methods
and design documents. That may result in a longer time to write
initial papers, but when something is released it is more thoroughly
prepared. Meanwhile, we keep our skills sharp by fixing bugs,
improving our own workflows, and actively exploring the landscape. All
these activities are part of the system we implement regularly, which
minimizes technical debt and allows space for serendipity to occur.</span></p><p><span>We have looked at RStudio and Roam Research as models of (some of) the
kinds of things we think Emacs can learn from and eventually improve upon.
‘Practice’ and ‘method’ keep coming up in our discussions as,
respectively, ‘more bottom up’ and ‘more top down’ ways of actualizing
things.  Concretely, we’ve been studying our own processes and looking
for the tools and settings that are the most conducive to the work we
want to do.  For example, instead of having a single Org Roam
directory shared via Git, what if we had ways of managing sharing of
notes across ‘graphs’?</span></p><p><span>Collaboration is familiar to teams across all domains. Even authors
working alone will collaborate with their past and future selves. What
is common for all collaborators is that the transfer of information
must be uninhibited.  If we all had our slipboxes online, we could
interlink them.</span><a class="firn-footnote-ref" href="#" id="fn-"><sup></sup></a><span>  This would generalize </span><strong><span>ORCiD</span></strong><span>, and allow people to
reference processes that are undergoing evolution.  Maybe a service
like this would turn into a ‘Tinder for academics’—helping to match
people based on their interests (or similar people in different
fields).  So, what’s the price point?  Instead of paying money to go
to conferences, now we can spontaneously make conferences and
workshops.  As a guess, $750.0 per user per year might be a fair price—for those who can afford to pay it—if the service helps people to
do better research and saves a bunch of travel.  We could also set up
a pricing model proportional to each country’s carbon emissions or
something like that.</span></p><p><span>In our concrete methods, we have aligned ourselves with the ‘</span><a class="firn-external" href="https://longtermist.substack.com/" target="_blank">long-term
perspective</a><span>’.  This includes both retrospective and prospective
thinking.  For example, the things that were timely 7 years ago might
not be so timely now; in many cases the relevance of a given
innovation goes down over time.  However, Emacs has an evolutionary
character that has allowed it to keep up with the times—becoming
more relevant and useful ever since Steele and Stallman started to
systematize </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://www.oreilly.com/openbook/freedom/ch06.html" target="_blank">Editor MACroS</a><span> for the Text Editor and Corrector (TECO)
program.  Not only has the technology evolved, but so has the social
setting in which this work is done.  Whereas the concepts underlying
the free software movement were based on “</span><a class="firn-external" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-paper.html" target="_blank">communal sharing</a><span>” of source
code, these methods can be extended and allow us to synthesize new
relationships within broader semiotic commons.  Emacs can become part
of a system for addressing large-scale existential problems, by
expanding the frontier of what’s possible for human beings.</span></p></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-5"><h5 class="firn-headline firn-headline-5" id="40m-demo-+-20m-of-question-time"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>40m demo + 20m of question time</span></span></h5><section><ul><li><p><span>To be developed over next 3 weeks, assuming we spend some time later polishing the proposal!</span></p></li><li><p><span>One of them can be "Going Public" — what are the others?</span></p></li></ul></section></div></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="par"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>PAR</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#10m">10m</a></span></span></h3><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-5"><h5 class="firn-headline firn-headline-5" id="1-review-the-intention:-what-did-we-expect-to-learn-or-make-together?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>1.

These are places where we are walking nearer to the frontier of what’s possible with Emacs.  With people who have expertise in Elisp we can push the boundaries of the circle; it’s an iterative process of improvement in which we’re taking part.

So is
"project lead" and other people have been happy to spend time on it.
So you have a leader and active participants (e.g., helping with the
event).</span></p><p><span>Since we’re all co-writers we’re all active participants, but LV has
taken a more inactive role since September.  In this duration, others
might have wanted to become inactive, perhaps due to the added work
coming from PLoP.  However if we had a taxonomy of modes of
engagement, it might make it easier for leaders and participants to
get an estimate of how much time things would take.</span></p><p><span>The problem: if you cut the head out of a project, it shouldn’t flail
around.  I’m still going to be involved with EmacsConf, and can still
keep track of what ERG wants to do.  I can’t afford to be an active
lead on an ERG-EmacsConf talk.  But why was I feeling the pressure to
do so?  I’m averse of seeing projects we’ve put energy towards... not
being made good.</span></p><p><span>"Reliability" is a big concept, beyond just being part of SRE.
Considering the PLoP stuff, some of us felt overwhelmed: this is the
worst moment to be dropping a project that we care about because it
feels like it will be absorbed somewhere else.  As soon as we finish
PLoP... will we throw everything that we have put off into this?</span></p><p><span>If we consider the 2 weeks we’ve spent working on the ERG-EmacsConf
talk...</span></p><ul><li><p><span>NA: It’s not like we’re going anywhere.  We’ve done a lot of work
  already!</span></p></li><li><p><span>RP: A week or two from now, we won’t forget where we’ve left the
  work, that should be fine.</span></p></li><li><p><span>LV: So where I’m sitting right now, for September I’ve been phasing
  out involvement in PLoP (happy to be on the periphery); for ERG, it
  feels like I’ve been able to organise the meeting, and organising
  towards the immediate objective of an ERG-EmacsConf presentation.
  However I didn’t want to create another separate time to work on the
  proposal.</span></p></li><li><p><span>The problem is that I thought we would have time to make proposals
  after the CFP, but due to the massive wave of interest, it’s hard to
  squeeze things in as we hoped.  Now it feels like this work has been
  going down the drain as a result of the overcrowded CFP.  Changing
  course would require more energy than I actually have now... I don’t
  have a great confidence to do this!</span></p></li><li><p><span>There’s a setback, but I can’t adapt to change course.</span></p></li><li><p><span>So far I only had a few minutes to change the plan (I only had 5
  minutes).</span></p></li><li><p><span>RP: Since we have til the 17th, we can avoid being stuck with a commitment; we just commit to ourselves to make it. And at that point we have in 90% done.</span></p></li><li><p><span>NA: if we just pre-record it, the organisers won’t feel stressed out, and it streamlines the whole event.</span></p></li><li><p><span>LV: I do want it to be polished, so maybe this is why I don’t want to be in the leadership role.  We discussed this with regard to the Flaws workshop: we wanted to deliver something on par with our expectations.</span></p></li><li><p><span>The hard work should pay off... no pressure!</span></p></li><li><p><span>The problem now is that I mobilise perfectionism, but this can be toxic if we don’t have a lot of time to prepare something.</span></p></li><li><p><span>It’s the conundrum of "reduce the content" — so it won’t have the chocolate chips or whatever it needs on it.</span></p></li><li><p><span>RP: But we can leave the opportunity of presenting it in January, doing even better since there is more time!  If by the 17th we have enough ideas we could say we have a second event in part of the pre-recorded meeting.</span></p></li><li><p><span>PLoP feels like it has been a Damocles sword: we’ve spent a lot of time trying to raise it above our head.  I don’t want to be responsible for putting another sword on our head!</span></p></li><li><p><span>NA: ...leader of?</span></p></li><li><p><span>LV: of the whole "going public", the talks we had planned.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Why do we keep coming back to the going public stuff?  It’s an easy pithy thing.  Any action towards doing something publicly.</span></p></li><li><p><span>LV: The problem for me: I’m feeling quite ill at ease with the concept of putting strife on people... whether </span><em><span>organisational</span></em><span> or... I don’t want to have people sacrifice evenings or weekends which we are doing as passion projects.  With PLoP this has been happening; and I’ve been feeling ill at ease with ERG-EmacsConf and trying to meet deadlines.  So then super-opposed to having a short deadline for something that requires more working hours or a changed scope.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>I still want to participate in ERG, but I want to guarantee that if extra work is required, we’ll require due notice (like with a contract, next week we would need another hour, are you OK with this).  So we could figure out the taxonomy of involvement/participation before we embark on another topic.</span></p><p><span>I’ve had trouble from the side looking at how you were interacting with PLoP. Some of the pressure was definitely put by PLoP.  Semi- dropping off and feeling like the boat was rocking... makes me want to intervene, when I see problems, I want to barge in and fix them manumilitary...</span></p><p><span>So delayed communication? I don’t want to rustle feelings?</span></p><p><span>The organisation in September has been bad, but I’m echoing Ray’s plea to come up w/ a good way to organise our work together; with ERG or Hyperreal we’re pretty much the same people.  We don’t seem to have the tooling to compartmentalise these differently.  These are venues of work (not para-work) that has none of the financial sustainability that comes with work.  If we realise we’ve invested 4 hours of work towards something and we only have notes and stife that comes from poor organisation... some people might sponge up more than this.  I want to prevent any chain reaction that gets everyone distressed.  I did touch base with Joe recently.</span></p></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-5"><h5 class="firn-headline firn-headline-5" id="replies"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Replies</span></span></h5><section><p><span>RP: Better said sooner rather than later.

In a chat with Alex: I knew I wanted to keep swimming and free software.  It’s easy to circumscribe swimming and work-stuff.  But with FLOSS stuff it keeps growing and adapting.  I would like to put a charm on it, and would like the reliability there-for.  Fluctuations from Org Roam, EmacsConf, ERG, CRDT... it would need an approvals process.  We already put 2 hours per week here!</span></p><p><span>JC: To bounce back on what RP was saying, this was great preparation for the PLoP workshop: we would know the strategies to work through people’s problems, we would have an analyst to know...; and we would have a kaiju-coordinator that would look at the micro-perturbations that could happen; what LV brought today was such a micro-perturbation.  In the scenario language that we’ve been developing, we’ve been able to work through this.</span></p><p><span>NA: PLoP will be ending next week anyway. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</span></p><p><span>It will end!</span></p><p><span>What do we want to learn from the experience?  What do we want to change going forward?</span></p><p><span>NA: Going forward we all need to be on the same page, if we take on things tangential/parallel... it did feel like we were trying to move things fast and it created strife, definitely.</span></p><p><span>RP: In addition, the fact that we have these different things means that we can’t always consider them in isolation (erg, workshop... limited time!).  We need to take them all into account, and if you focus on one project at a time it might seem you have time, but only if you neglect the other projects.</span></p><p><span>LV: With peeragogy or pedagogy... OK but how about "cooperation"?  Literally, Co-operation.  Means that we are synchronising our schedule in a way.  The important thing would be to ensure that the common-ground is the same, and to develop patterns or recognise patterns of overcommitment.</span></p><p><span>E.g. "a meeting the next day". Either you double-time it and come up with more time, or you do something sub-par.</span></p><p><span>NA: Doing something is better than nothing!</span></p><p><span>RP: Sometimes!  It depends on circumstances.</span></p><p><span>NA: For me, for PLoP, it would be a great opportunity even if we don’t finish it 100%, it would still be worth it to run through it and see what comes up.  It’s a work in progress, same thing with any conference with Emacs we’d say "this is what we’ve done so far" and a conversation there will move things forward.</span></p><p><span>LV: This reminds me of The Phoenix Project which is about dev-ops: "I am developing Org Roam" and "How do I deploy Org Roam to be used within a company?"  This is linked to the concept of business.  So, too much WIP kills business because you get a huge stack of things to do.  So when you mentioned this, it made me think, how do we manage stuff to be done in a business?  Organisation is one of them, trying to keep WIP low enough is a good thing to do.  So, for me, getting something out there rather than nothing at all... Ray was in a middle-ground (with complexity)... but I am kind of the opposite from Noorah in that I have trouble birthing things in the world unless it is perfect.</span></p><p><span>One of the problems that I have also is that between ERG and Hyperreal: we’ve talked about grants.  But for me I don’t see ERG that way anymore.  Sometimes it’s research, sometimes its facilitation, but I’m not seeing it as an avenue for money.  The idea of getting a job as a developer has decreased the impetus to get money for the other things.  I didn’t like the idea of developing Org Roam via payments from Roam Research, there were a lot of ties attached.  Hyperreal does have the goal of getting money; even if it is an NGO.  But having financial sustainability coming from a project like this feels like a lot of strife.</span></p><p><span>RP: three comments: (1) whether to cancel or go forward, a lot has to do with the expectations of a venue. E.g., a workshop, people are OK with WIP.  In a different place where they expect a finished presentation, it’s better to drop out. (2) The place I have heard WIP is in medical research, where we would have work-in-progress seminars, and a much lower expectation on explaining how your work is progressing. (3) Relative to the NGO: going back to PlanetMath, </span><em><span>you</span></em><span> might not need personal funding, but if things get to a certain stage in an organisation it may need funding to move things forward.  ERG is nowhere near that, but we had that discussion on PlanetMath.  (We had many discussions about this.)</span></p><p><span>LV: As a quick complexification: I wouldn’t say I’m opposed to getting money from these avenues, but it is causing stife to think of this as a financial sustainability pathway.  Even a grant isn’t sustainable enough, because there’s an end-date and a finite sum.  I need a more fleeting point on the horizon with no end.  This feels artificial in a way, but I need to conjure up a sense of perenity, and then I can help other people.  E.g., if Joe was talking about changing jobs... I might get money from Hyperreal on the side, but I’d rather think of "sustainability" as what I do on my own.  At 27 I’m the youngest one here, most of my studies have been funded by parents, but I kind of need to prove that I can sustain myself on my own.  If I tie it to a group and we are struggling to make ends meet... this won’t bring the sustainability that I need.  I’d rather work for a corporation and be able to afford FLOSS on the side.</span></p><p><span>RP: Personal sustainability separate from projects makes sense; the other direction has to do with what the project needs.  "This is what we need to do ERG."  But these are separate issues.  With PM, we might have needed... more than a handful of people on a volunteer basis.</span></p><p><span>JC: The organisational health of ERG & Hyperreal is miles ahead of where PlanetMath’s was.  We might not enjoy the process of communicating clearly at times, but it’s having real benefits.  With regards to Hyperreal, it </span><strong><span>is</span></strong><span> a company, and JC has to pay money to keep it as such; it is like a startup with training-wheels, with the wheels being our </span><em><span>desire</span></em><span> to make it a company.  With regards to payments, we were talking with Qiantan on developing a new WWW, we’d probably want some money for that.</span></p><p><span>LV: Qiantan doesn’t love the formal things in his PhD... but it’s presently his leisure time stuff.  Money would be nice to help keep me afloat.  It would be nice to get money for working on expertise and fun.  But we always have a difference between work and leisure.  A para-professional thing is akin to leisure... maybe motivated by money as well... but typically driven by interest.  I want to get the professional setting going (where I’m getting paid!) so that the FLOSS life can be removed from money consideration or money-corrupts tangents.  My goals to monetise Org-Roam: some were good ideas, some were rotten apples from the start.  We have to make compromises, but I’d rather maintain an element of purity that we haven’t had in the past.</span></p><p><span>RP: Part of this depends on the scale.  If it depends on you developing something by yourself, as long as you find sustainability and work on it on the side, OK, but if it becomes a bigger thing that involves other people... cf. Project Gutenberg or PlanetMath because people thought it could work pure-volunteer.</span></p><p><span>LV: This reminds me of a point Noorah mentioned about time invested into leisure.  In a garden or evergreen notes... it feels to me that it’s an organic process, for a passion project or leisure project, to become something that can(~) possibly scale up.  E.g. Org Roam was something that I was just contributing to.  I wasn’t thinking it was going to be a big project; later it starts to have visibility.  But it’s still within the level of scale where I feel we can do it: "it’s just matter of time".  The Roam Research stuff and desire to scale up weren’t lining up.  Money at this point kind of corrupted my approach.  Programming is an interesting example: passion projects can become things you can make money from. But, say, swimming: I’m never going to live from this.  Something to leverage in the time spent w/ ERG: cultivating a garden of projects, and if one of them is a grand idea, we should feel it.  "Going public" is like a seed that none of really recognised.  We have to decide whether to uproot it or potentially corrupt everything else...</span></p><p><span>NA: I never understood the whole public thing!  I never understood why we even talked about it... still confused, that’s my take.</span></p><p><span>RP: This goes back to what I was trying to get at the other day with QH, with the Emacs Web and scaling.  Is this going to be something on a small scale that’s done by a few amateurs, versus something that we want to be much bigger with a small prototype?  It’s important to be clear, not just about roles, but also the scope of a project up front, so that you don’t get confused about what it is.</span></p><p><span>LV: For me, low-scale stuff that eventually turns bigger scale and might need money is based on regular weekly involvement, and after some investment of time, it can turn bigger.  If we think about something that is bigger-scale-first, I find it easier to think if I’m being paid up front for me to feel safe doing it.  If I were to be recruited by Criteo, I’d think about bigger projects because I don’t have to worry about money.  For the FLOSS stuff I’d rather enshrine a (smaller) amount of time that might lead somewhere eventually.  But it needs to be a very smooth process that is erring on the side of caution regarding financing (even if it takes risks with ideas).</span></p><p><span>JC: On the top of getting the money upfront; with Hyperreal, with the 80k figure, the money would have been upfront, but it would probably have been an element of pressure.  We might be closer now to a think-tank, or to a group of consultants; but we’re definitely not like a unicorn startup.</span></p><p><span>RP: Visionary, DIY engineer, startup, big company... most things can have a similar plot line.  We’re in the early stages here.  So having something else finance it vs seeking financing (JC: or customers) is more appropriate.</span></p><p><span>LV: I don’t want to imprint too much onto ERG.  ERG is a horizontal process; I don’t want the direction to be too influenced by the direction of my life.  E.g., scheduling.  I might err on the side of caution, but others might want to do something else.  Let me know if I’m blocking something.</span></p></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="par"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>PAR</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#10m">10m</a></span></span></h3><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-5"><h5 class="firn-headline firn-headline-5" id="1-review-the-intention:-what-did-we-expect-to-learn-or-make-together?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>1.

We thought we might want to
write a whitepaper as an output.  We met approximately weekly up until
the summer holiday, and resumed afterward.  We had several guest
attendees over the weeks.  We took notes on each meeting using a new
‘conflict-free replicated data type’ package (CRDT).  We did a Project
Action Review (PAR) at the end of each meeting.  We prepared a Causal
Layered Analysis (CLA) of our meetings.  We wrote up our experiences
as a case study within a joint submission to the Pattern Languages of
Programs Conference (PLoP 2021).  We also prepared and delivered an
interactive workshop related at that conference.</span></p><p><span>We can now understand the roles we used in our workshop in relation to
the roles that we are taking in our ERG meetings; e.g., situational
reports (sitreps) from a ‘Kaiju Communicator’, or topic modelling from
a ‘Designer’; and can we make use of the information about where
conflict appears through the thinking of an ‘Analyst’?</span></p><p><span>Going forward we’re inspired by the Gilliam-linked documentaries "Lost
in La Mancha?" and "</span><a class="firn-external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_Who_Killed_Don_Quixote#He_Dreams_of_Giants" target="_blank">He Dreams of Giants</a><span>" and the </span><strong><span>Kenneth Cole
Productions</span></strong><span> story.  We can think of our experience as a movie trailer
parked next to the EmacsConf station.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>5-10 minutes: (brief description/outline)</span></p></li><li><p><span>20 minutes: (brief description/outline)</span></p></li><li><p><span>40 minutes: (brief description/outline)</span></p></li></ul><p><span>Availability and preferred Q&A approach:</span></p><p><span>Speaker release: XXX</span></p></blockquote></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><h4 class="firn-headline firn-headline-4" id="pause"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>PAUSE</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#5m">5m</a></span></span></h4></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><h4 class="firn-headline firn-headline-4" id="overflow-for-emacsconf"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Overflow for EmacsConf</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#25m">25m</a></span></span></h4></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><h4 class="firn-headline firn-headline-4" id="prepare-the-debrief-plop"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Prepare the debrief PLoP</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#10m">10m</a></span></span></h4><section><p><span>OBJECTIVE: Have a plan for the debrief session on </span><span class="firn-timestamp">2021/10/120</span><span> (UTC)</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Started with a paper for Futures </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03736" target="_blank">Patterns, anticipation and participatory futures</a><span>; this new submission one got accepted</span></p></li><li><p><span>We did incorporate some of what we thought about with ERG</span></p></li><li><p><span>Another thing that came up along the way (with ERG)</span></p></li><li><p><span>Thinking about the overlaps (is this an ERG thing, Hyperreal, Peeragogy?</span></p></li><li><p><span>Thinking about future materials for the workshop.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Thinking about rôles in terms of scalability: Who is going to be doing what going forward?</span></p></li><li><p><span>Can we make some approximations around what our availability is going to be on several timelines</span></p></li><li><p><span>There was some strife along different levels… somewhat stressful for all of us; so… what can we learn from this?</span></p></li><li><p><span>The stife does have something to do with our transdisciplinary work, and outside commitments</span></p></li><li><p><span>This means we have to be more deliberate than people who were only focused on one thing</span></p></li><li><p><span>We started to get future-oriented future into our ways of thinking; i.e., ‘how would we like season 1 to go’; ‘what do we want to deliver a year from now?’</span></p></li><li><p><span>Can we retrospectively apply ‘scenarios’ to PLoP?

Research Group for weekly meetings.  During these meetings, we took notes
collaboratively, using a ‘conflict-free replicated data type’ package
(crdt.el); at the end of each session, we debriefed using a template that we
call a Project Action Review (PAR).  As as a meta-review of our sessions,
every six weeks we prepared a Causal Layered Analysis (CLA), which gave us
a different perspective on what we had done.  We reflected further on our
experiences and methods, linking our CLA to plans and design patterns.  As

the roles that we are taking in our ERG meetings; e.g., situational
reports (sitreps) from a ‘Kaiju Communicator’, or topic modelling from
a ‘Designer’; and can we make use of the information about where
conflict appears through the thinking of an ‘Analyst’?</span></p></blockquote></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="par"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>PAR</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#10m">10m</a></span></span></h3><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-5"><h5 class="firn-headline firn-headline-5" id="1-review-the-intention:-what-did-we-expect-to-learn-or-make-together?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>1.

Research
on/in/with Emacs back in October 2020. We’ve met almost every week
since then, and interviewed some interesting and varied guests. We
have a clearer idea of what what we want to talk about at the next
EmacsConf, and how we can be of service to researchers and Emacs
users. We have been using a workflow that helps us carefully review
progress, diagnose issues, and manage our energy.  We’re understanding
how research is done by doing it, and keeping careful track of the
process. If a session doesn’t go as well as hoped, we think about why
(especially Leo as chair). The idea is that you know what the bomb is, so you can at
least hope to defuse it later. We try to adapt gracefully to
circumstances as they evolve, without being reactive because we know
we will be back again next week and the week after, etc.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-5"><h5 class="firn-headline firn-headline-5" id="12-system"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>1.2 System</span></span></h5><section><p><span>If we tackle big enough projects, it will bring with it the need for
collaboration. (And we need to respect these other parties.) We like
to create tangible deliverables (e.g., journal articles). However,
“If we knew what the outcome was it wouldn’t be research” — therefore,
we’re focusing initially on research methods and design documents. So
far many of the stakeholders have to do with free software, open
communities, peer learning: all of this is part of a broader
initiative. All of them will need some degree of systematised
activities and documents. This is what we’re experimenting with; in
principle, we can provide meta-management workflows.  In the way we work together we make sure
to take account of emotions, not just a time table. We’ve been
experimenting with futures methods that help us use the future
intelligently: neither trying to do everything ‘live’, nor
overburdening the future with a bunch of plans that can’t be
realised.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-5"><h5 class="firn-headline firn-headline-5" id="13-worldview"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>1.3 Worldview</span></span></h5><section><p><span>We have looked at RStudio and Roam Research as models of (some of) the
kinds of things we think Emacs can eventually improve upon. Actually
getting there requires thinking about the specificity of what Emacs
can do. At least nominally, it is a system for editing. For example,
currently we can edit a wiki using Org Roam and Git. What about
editing distributed knowledge graphs? This would allow people to
reference ongoing research processes. Or we could go further and
contribute to the development of a new distributed read-write Web!
Alongside such software products could come various services, such as
a matchmaking service for academics, or a set of 24/7 virtual
conferences. To make such thing really useful, we need to get
coherence out of various long-running, diverse, and hetereogeneous
thought processes: and make sure we help people address real
problems. We can start small, working with the members of ERG and
their networks. We’re certainly not the only people who are struggling
with some unexpected commitments.  Successful adaptation requires the
articulation of an entire system. Thinking again about Emacs: its
current documentation is certainly useful, but it leaves many gaps,
some of which are filled in other ways (e.g., by mailing lists). As we
work we are paying attention to the growth not only of knowledge, but
also of capability. For this, we often rely on our feelings (getting
it, not getting it, accomplishing something or not, etc.).</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-5"><h5 class="firn-headline firn-headline-5" id="14-myth"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>1.4 Myth</span></span></h5><section><p><span>In our concrete methods, we have aligned ourselves with the ‘long-term
perspective’. This includes both retrospective and prospective
thinking. For example, the things that were timely 7 years ago might
not be now; in many cases the relevance of a given innovation goes down over
time. That said, Emacs has an evolutionary character that has
allowed it to keep up with the times — apparently becoming
increasingly relevant and useful ever since Steele and Stallman
started to systematise Editor MACroS for the Text Editor and Corrector
(TECO) program. Not only has the technology evolved, but so has the
social setting in which this work is done. After nearly a year of
working together, we’re now prepared to argue that other people should
consider getting together to create their own communities similar to
ours! The concepts underlying the free software movement were based on
“communal sharing” of source code: now we’re working on developing and
sharing other methods as well. Just like free software has
legitimately expanded the range of what’s humanly possible, so too may
further efforts expand frontier of possibility. As above, this takes
careful articulation, and a willingness to do truly original research
(without relying on fixed assumptions about what research is meant to
be, or where we will find value).</span></p></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><h4 class="firn-headline firn-headline-4" id="emacsconf:-storyboarding"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>EmacsConf: Storyboarding</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#35m">35m</a></span></span></h4><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-5"><h5 class="firn-headline firn-headline-5" id="meta"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Meta</span></span></h5><section><ul><li><p><span>We might want to think about the priorities of some of those points; it’s probably more important to talk about crdt.el than talking about the fact that we had the summer off.</span></p></li><li><p><span>JC: What about the local stake-holders?

Emacs in 2 hours a week for a year

This is our story:

The four of us met at EmacsConf 2020, and joined together around a
common interest in Emacs and research.  Since then, we have convened as
the Emacs Research Group for weekly meetings.  During these meetings, we
took notes collaboratively, using a ‘conflict-free replicated data type’
package (crdt.el); at the end of each session, we debriefed using a
template that we call a Project Action Review (PAR).  As as a
meta-review of our sessions, every six weeks we prepared a Causal
Layered Analysis (CLA), which gave us a different perspective on what we
had done.  We reflected further on our experiences and methods, linking
our CLA to plans and design patterns.  As a formal research output, we
contributed a write-up of these matters to a joint paper which we
presented at the Pattern Languages of Programs Conference (PLoP 2021).
The paper included an interactive workshop, in which we explored roles
in real-time problem solving and collaboration.

In our short talk we share information about these methods, making a
case for other people getting together and creating their own small
research communities similar to ours.

adapt methods from elite training, future studies, and collaborative
design, and apply them to address significant problems in social
networks. We focus on three such methods: we use Action Reviews to
implement social perception, Causal Layered Analysis to implement
social cognition, and Design Pattern Languages to implement social
action. To illustrate the methods in combination, we first develop a
case study, showing how we applied them to bootstrap a distributed
cross-disciplinary research seminar. We then use Causal Layered
Analysis to explore the ways in which the design pattern discourse has
been evolving. Building on these analyses, we elaborate several
scenarios for the future use of design patterns in large-scale
distributed collaboration. We conclude that the combination of methods
is robust to uncertainty -- by supporting adaptations as circumstances
change -- and that they can help people coming from different
backgrounds work together. In particular, we show how methods drawn
from other domains enrich and are enriched by design patterns; we
believe the analysis will be of interest to all of the communities
whose methods we draw upon.

What is included within it, and what is not?</span></p><ul><li><p><span>This is stemming from the fact that we’re all doing different things, and we dump multiple things onto those meetings, which feeds into a feeling of </span><em><span>indirection</span></em><span>.</span></p></li><li><p><span>JC: One of the best things about the meetings this far was that the chair was coming with an agenda, impelling a sense of direction, albeit too-pluralised</span></p></li><li><p><span>[vs "our objective is to get to Paris and then to Reims"]</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>LV: There are "Why we meet" and "How we meet" questions.</span></p></li><li><p><span>"If I can’t meet the bar to meet the meeting..."</span></p></li><li><p><span>-JC: What is the </span><em><span>bar</span></em><span> to joining those meetings?  What are the </span><em><span>norms</span></em><span> (which seems to be an inherently Buddhist terminology/concept).</span></p><ul><li><p><span>“A nice norm from Peeragogy is that: ‘we’re going to come at this time, and you’re welcome to join!’”</span></p></li><li><p><span>In Peeragogy, we thought so much about norms, positing that they’re a net benefit.</span></p></li><li><p><span>"Any edit is an improvement or intends to be"</span></p></li><li><p><span>Norms in a practical sense that impacts what actually happens in our activities.</span></p></li><li><p><span>CD: Assuming that the edit is an improvement has been very helpful. Also, w/ confusion / conflict: there’s a peeragy podcast episode about critical conversations...</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>JC: If we’re trying to clear up everything from the different overlapping meetings, that adds </span><em><span>massively</span></em><span> to the level of confusion.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>JC: NA had made a nice definition for the PLACARD workshop, optimising the definition around “our meeting here and then </span><em><span>is</span></em><span> the workshop” (this is a start)</span></p></li><li><p><span>LV: if you’ve accumulated a lot of cruft, you could just clear the table and throw out the playbook... get it back... and see what is going on.  We could do something similar with ERG; because we have more history there would be a larger playbook.  We started a discussion WRT patterns... but... we may be getting a bit lost into conceptual aspects; norms as a frontier between how and why... but hereforth, discussing what the norms are.</span></p></li></ul></li></ul></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-5"><h5 class="firn-headline firn-headline-5" id="norms"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Norms</span></span></h5><section><ul><li><p><span>NA: we use emacs, we all have this in common; it’s fun to do everything in Emacs even in these 2 hours.  This is part of the participation</span></p></li><li><p><span>JC: Second that; it’s quite funny to meet on Saturdays for this!  This is light, enjoyable work.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>LV: Not a Church of Emacs but...</span></p></li><li><p><span>RP: "Not a cult (tm)"</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>NA: Another is the art of collaboration, the art of different backgrounds coming in for a shared idea or project... this is a strong norm, we’re here to collaborate</span></p></li><li><p><span>LV: I was going to go back to what Joe was saying in terms of light, enjoyable work; light/work is somewhat in tension (labour vs work, toiling?); for me, exploring it is about "making progress that is vaguely professional" and "the mode of being that should not be taxing".  Work on its own is taxing; it’s something we have to do to sustain your existence, and you (may) damage yourself; light-work ... it’s trying to cut off the element of strife, we discussed since June/July.  Before that it was excitement only.  The Song of Innocence may have been lost, but it might be distilled into a Song of Experience that preserves everyone from generating strife for themselves and others.</span></p></li><li><p><span>RP: For me, having to do system admin, reset computer isn’t light work; I can’t do it on a quick timeline of a few weeks. Part of it is to do w/ the other things that have been piled up since June.</span></p></li><li><p><span>LV: As a member of the group, backlog could take 3 months, but what about the 10 minute version that would get ≈80% of the results?  What would actually solve the issue?  E.g. microphone patching would fit in given sufficient space; you have proficient people who can bring it down from weeks to days, or weeks to minutes with collaboration dedicating our mind to it.  It’s fine if it’s only one problem, we go on w/ our day, but if it starts piling up and can last months, then it seems mindboggling; we all have stuff to do but it is our own responsibility to make sure we have space for the meetings we do attend.  If you come from a position of strife you have to wonder was it a move forward?  Or backwards?  Or no step at all?</span></p><ul><li><p><span>I’m frustrated by apologies w/o follow-through that would allow collaboration to actually resolve the problem. You couldn’t dream of a better team of people to walk through the process of "collaborative work with Emacs": we are writing that playbook.  We are developing tools, designing </span><code>org-meetings.el</code><span> to make this for everyone.  Your inputs are valuable here, but can be undermined by not ironing out the kinks.</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>RP: The tech problems have pre-requisites. I would appreciate help if I can get it (like I appreciated help w/ email).</span></p></li><li><p><span>JC: Tech problems have prerequisites, and LV is a specialist on those issues, and could potentially help on this.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>JC: Restorative justice idea</span></p></li><li><p><span>LV: I can justify this if I can guarantee it won’t impact me negatively with regard to my emotions.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Think of it as a meta-process that is running in my mind.  If it is causing emotional damage I have to continually think "do I need to abort the situation"; I’m a little at the end of the rope. I’ll accept the apology for reactivity at the start and offer my own for sternness; but the history here is what makes this sternness accessible as my reaction. It felt to me that the only way.</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>Potential and concrete farewells; if this is the case.</span></p></li><li><p><span>LV: I was either reacting sternly or leaving the meeting; but if I am at this point as the past chair and someone taking the notes, it’s a red flag, and I would heavily encourage us to think about this and work on it as much as we can work on it.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>RP: To clarify:...</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>JC: I’d heard from LV and NA that the CLA had not been a tool that was appropriated by all.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>JC: It feels like this discussion is akin to CLA, but maybe going to its mere meta roots.</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>LV: This is essentializing CLA/PAR workflow "How are things going" and going back to the roots of what it’s supposed to be about.  No matter how unpleasant difficult conversations, it is more effective to have them.  Previously we did get value from CLA, but could have had 3-4 times as much serendipity w/ broader adoptation.</span></p></li><li><p><span>NA: If I imagine our Saturday meetings: "Light creative ‘work’."  We bring in our creativity, there’s no hard outcomes that we have to get right now, let’s come in relaxed, share our creative ideas, that will help us allow serendipity to happen.  If we come in with hard core tasks... sure we have an agenda to guide us...  can we come together on a consensus of how these</span></p></li><li><p><span>JC: What does it feel like to have a philosophy group?  Those Saturday sessions feel pretty close to a symposium.</span></p></li><li><p><span>JC: One way we could possibly define ERG (and we don’t have to) is that it’s a subgroup of Hyperreal...?</span></p><ul><li><p><span>But presently it doesn’t have such an institutional affiliation.</span></p></li><li><p><span>(NA: ... but clearly we still want to have fun with Emacs.)</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>Could relate to longer-term projects</span></p></li><li><p><span>What does it mean to be an Emacs group?</span></p></li><li><p><span>We could then mobilise research, not on "Emacs", but what is an "Emacs-Group"?</span></p><ul><li><p><span>This could bring forward the sociability</span></p></li><li><p><span>Maybe we should try to provide a recipe to people to achieve certain similar things in their week</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>JC: Since Charlie is a relative newcomer to Emacs it would be interesting to discuss later how that’s a limiting factor;</span></p><ul><li><p><span>LV: how can we encourage people to work in the meetings to have those social moments where they are sharing?  We do have outputs... how do we make sure that people who have a similar level of proficiency can achieve similar stuff?  There could be a study run based on these methods.  There could be more people interacting with Emacs, sharing the philosophy, in a way that’s visual, understandable, and that makes it obvious that the tools are instrumental to the philosophy... and how good they seem.</span></p></li></ul></li></ul></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><h4 class="firn-headline firn-headline-4" id="scheduling"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Scheduling</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#5m">5m</a></span></span></h4><section><ul><li><p><span>Next ERG meeting: </span><span class="firn-timestamp">2022/1/15</span><span> (4 weeks from now)</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Allows time to reflect, bring norms, expectations, and such)</span></p></li><li><p><span>This idea has universal acclaim</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>RP: Would be glad to keep in touch meanwhile depending on what’s convenient</span></p></li><li><p><span>LV: I will be consumating the break; I’ve been meeting-fatigued, and now feeling better at the pool but still need a break to be able to ask myself questions about meetings and think about them</span></p></li><li><p><span>JC: I could look into the technical stuff with RP, Charlie, or whoever would be willing; this could be folded into a peeragogy schedule</span></p></li><li><p><span>CD: Back to ERG, Noorah offered a long time ago to help with Emacs and I’ve procrastinated about a year on that offer; if I could be "optionally" available in January 15th.

The first thing we need to worry about with regard to a future, is to have feedback (which works!); in the spirit of lightness we shouldn’t outlaw feedback.  If we think something isn’t going the way we think it should be going, we should be voicing that.  And I like the group/therapy idea, or something that’s not just about problem-resolution.

If you have to write 2–3 papers to academic to validate the idea, it detracts more than it helps.</span></p></li><li><p><span>NA: And it doesn’t necessarily have to be a published physical book, it can be something more interactive</span></p></li><li><p><span>JC: Could we go back to RP, suggest him to come check in with us on a monthly basis?</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>How to bring an audience? (Or a public?)</span></p><ul><li><p><span>JC: If we look like at our the presentations</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>LV: We will have EmacsConf, that public!  Do we need a panopticon for checking on immediate progress?  Well, if we log on a website, people can check it if they really want to (having been recruited from EmacsConf etc)</span></p></li><li><p><span>LV: We do have interested parties that we gathered from previous EmacsConf, who could be invited.  "Thinking about why we are meeting today" and simplifying; knowing we can work together, having 60% of the tools.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Open to novelty with other members, and don’t want to start dealing again with problems from last year</span></p><ul><li><p><span>JC: Perhaps we should think in it in terms of network: we’re doing this stuff here and now, us three, but people interested by what we’re doing would only be one or two hops away from hearing about what we’re doing.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Variant of the leader/member/observer ontology we talked about.</span></p></li><li><p><span>There’d still be "members", and we’d want to make all the people active in the way they can provide.  If people want to share things that they discovered, good!  If others want to share such things with us, great, they can share things with us.</span></p></li><li><p><span>So, this gets back to NA’s ideas about individual contributions; maybe Ray’s been sharing notes to this effect (and without stress)</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>NA: The goal is to discuss ideas on how to utilise Emacs for the work that we do, and I like the soft goal of EmacsConf that keeps us a bit focus</span></p></li><li><p><span>JC: If Emacs itself remains the focus of those sessions, then we’re good to go with EmacsConf or any other venue that talks about Emacs.</span></p></li><li><p><span>LV: We’ve been striving for simplicity, even with some long points also tied to this purpose.  We’re highlighting one of the problems we had before.  Some people came to the meetings because they enjoyed our company and energy, and, yes, it’s energising!  But we did lose focus of what we’re trying to do.  And based on these things we ended up committing to PLoP and thinking about how we work as a group, not about Emacs.  So, the objective of "just nailing the EmacsConf next year" could be centralising.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>That’s for ERG; more broadly we haven’t been meeting for coffee chats or workshops over the holiday.  If people were coming to ERG b/c it was giving them energy, or just to share their expectations of the week.  I’d say: I’m looking forward to modifying ERG to the above purpose; perhaps we should also be looking forward to other moments (e.g., 1-to-1 conversations or efforts on technology); can we use the time slots that we were using before for "actual work" more for some therapy aspects.  Let’s try to think in terms of therapy + generosity in the other times.</span></p></li></ul></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><h4 class="firn-headline firn-headline-4" id="open-forum"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Open forum</span></span></h4><section><p><span>Meta:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>This section would be nice to cover, but only if time allows us to.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Simplicity</span></p></li><li><p><span>Context of UWE work (≈£10K to budget in detail and then spend down)</span></p></li><li><p><span>Share information with open source work</span></p></li><li><p><span>LV: Wondering how to place "something": the commse lot of things latel I’ve been equipping myself to jump.  And now is the time to mobilise this great stuff, regardless of interview-prep.  I’ve been in stasis, which people often associate with depression and powerlessness.  I’ve been preparing a bunch of soft skills and asides.  There’s an unquenchable fire to do stuff!  To mobilise the same amount of regularity and performance that I’ve been able to mobilise in sports back into programming.  I’m not starved for projects (e.g., fixing things in emacs or getting a job in programming).  As a result I’d like to have some focus on my fortés!  E.g. technical aspects of the meetings, design features we would like to have in Emacs.  Timers, TODO-moving, all that.  Bringing distance, designing stuff together.  So I’d appreciate it if these moments can also bring material that I can work on, and I’d like this to be the individual contribution that I bring to the Saturday meetings.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>NA: Yes, part of this is about thinking about solutions that make our meetings better.  We’re prototyping ideas on Saturdays.  Nothing crazy.  Nothing too serious, let’s have fun creating.</span></p></li><li><p><span>LV: Yes, there’s the idea of casual progression; but I also want the goal to be great.  A great suite for meetings inside Emacs.  Casual rhythm of daily or weekly work is fine.</span></p></li><li><p><span>NA: Would an org mode suite for meetings be a reasonable goal to present?</span></p></li><li><p><span>LV: If last year was the year of collective work, I was spending more time in meetings, I’d like more time in solo experiences but also to connect it to the collective work wagon.  Not necessarily more meetings, but more about the "non-stress" dimensions (e.g., before Saturday); I don’t want to have to report on bullshit work for example.  I want to be able to do solo work that’s meaningful for ERG or other endeavours.  If we want to have other sessions about, say, slides.  We won’t do it on Saturdays; but with an ambiance that’s more stressful.</span></p></li></ul></li></ul><p><span>Points:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Try to get org-tag-realign (not actual name) working for NA.</span></p></li></ul></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="par"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>PAR</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#10m">10m</a></span></span></h3><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-5"><h5 class="firn-headline firn-headline-5" id="1-review-the-intention:-what-did-we-expect-to-learn-or-make-together?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>1.

A possible solution is, that we’d work asyncronously on our separate ideas, by utilizing *Org Roam*; e.g., RP+JC could meet to talk about ob-servant, bio-physics... the notes could appear in the same wiki; if we have it documented then we don’t have to tell everything on Saturday; I can just check the Org Roam, and it might say at high level everything I need to know</span></p><ul><li><p><span>RP: Yes, similar to the </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://peeragogy.org/wrap" target="_blank">Wrap</a><span> pattern.

I think it’s fair to discuss “Here’s what I’ve tried to do with Emacs and didn’t manage”.

This means that they can be used for distributed project management.  (This is quite different from the classical Alexandrian view; but coherent with the contemporary "Objectives and Key Results" management strategy.)</span></p><p><span>(2) Patterns are necessarily contextual.  This is a classical Alexandrian point of view, which can supported by references to Simondon's concept of the pre-individual.  A related observation is that patterns are "processual" in nature; this supports (1).  (NB. Context-specificity is in tension with transferability between contexts.  This tension is itself a "meta-pattern".)</span></p><p><span>(3) Patterns are "teachable methods".  This is explained by Leitner.  This also suggests that patterns are "mathetic" in nature (i.e., they are informative teaching-and-learning objects).  This connects patterns to the work of Alan Mathison Turing.</span></p><p><span>(4) Patterns are strongly akin to "institutions" in Elinor Ostrom's terminology.  Therefore, Ostrom's principles for institutional design should be relevant as guidance for the creation of pattern-languages.  I discussed Ostrom's principles here: http://metameso.org/~joe/papers/corneli2016institutional.pdf  (While this probably won't put us on a direct path to the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, it would be useful to learn from someone who got one.)</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><h4 class="firn-headline firn-headline-4" id="&quot;other&quot;-inputs--objects-of-the-process?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>"Other" inputs / objects of the process...?</span></span></h4><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-5"><h5 class="firn-headline firn-headline-5" id="methods"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Methods</span></span></h5></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-5"><h5 class="firn-headline firn-headline-5" id="appropriating-the-wiki"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Appropriating the wiki</span></span></h5></div></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="bar"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>BAR</span></span></h3><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-5"><h5 class="firn-headline firn-headline-5" id="2-establish-what-is-happening:-what-and-how-are-we-learning?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>2.

Peer

much "this is how it should be done".  Whereas here we are talking
about patterns that are set within a network of patterns that describe
how they could be used by different people </span><em><span>3 different scenarios</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><span>A few different tools that can be used to explore it.</span></p><p><span>Proposed policies; existing governmental policies; E.g., local policy
"all food must be sourced from within 50 miles of this particular
borough"</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Maybe it's unsustainable to bring food in, or there are
  over-fractious politics at play.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>But where is the evidence coming from that allows you to articulate
the problem in this way.</span></p><p><span>Then you'd have multiple policies (e.g., food fridges, donations,
allotments, community farms).</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Then you start to demonstrate the process by which you organise your
  thoughts.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>Architects might then say: "We build a food hub at an allotment site
to allow people to exchange food from local gardens."</span></p><p><span>(What are the design solutions that will solve that problem.)</span></p><p><span>How different is this to how they would solve things normally?</span></p><p><span>Maybe it's not, but we might get some extra pixie dust out of looking
at how they solve things, looking at how people think about things
(e.g., food waste — cf. UWE </span><em><span>Food Network</span></em><span> and FoodTinder; how do you
redistribute food around the city: So, advertise your food, and you
can swipe left or right if you need the food for a given recipe).</span></p><p><span>— What information do you need to make this work?  E.g., what does a
dating site rely on?</span></p><p><span>— What’s modelling adding to that?  E.g., if we had a certain amount
of resource and certain amount of scarity, how to optimally ensure
that people are interacting in the right space?</span></p><p><span>"How far are you willing to go to get some...?"</span></p><p><span>This is something interesting to model.</span></p><p><span>Cf.

Amazon... "Let’s learn what people want before they know".  How can we
make the food system intelligent in this way?  Similar to disaster

Inference), systems will be evaluated in light of a problem faced and

problem.  Each problem-system will be described as a pattern, setting
out the evidence and hypothesis for resolution.  Each pattern is
itself evolving over time, shaped by new findings; contextual,

reason to </span><strong><span>Prepare questions</span></strong><span> </span><a href="#*-prepare-questions"></a><span> in advance of the

that our shared expertise is on supporting </span><strong><span>Deep engagement</span></strong><span> [[* Deep

reflect on what we did during the meeting, and sometimes allows us to

we realised that the first question of the Project Action Review
(“Review the intention: what do we expect to learn or make together?”)
should be engaged with as a meta-point, early in the session.  Broadly
the PAR helps us to cultivate a sense of shared mindfulness about what

"Debug your init."  If you put some distance between the problem and
you, the meeting is a social moment, the PAR is meant to bring to the
surface a lot of stuff.  It’s meant to answer a number of problems.
It addresses </span><em><span>many</span></em><span> problems or surfaces-for-learning.</span></p><p><span>Maybe the PAR isn’t the pattern, reviewing the meeting is actually a</span><em><span>group</span></em><span> of patterns.  Each of the questions could be a different
pattern.</span></p><p><span>So, above, in the summary we simplify.  The </span><strong><span>context</span></strong><span> could then be

With patterns I like bio and chemistry metaphors; thinking about transmutating a problem into a solution, or making hay from the surface for learning.  There’s something transformational/transactional about patterns.</span></p><p><span>They’re often presented as antidotes to problems.  They make the problems (negative sense) go away.  So this is a kind of health metaphor.</span></p></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><h4 class="firn-headline firn-headline-4" id="why-did-the-patterns-not-stick?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Why did the patterns not stick?</span></span></h4><section><p><span>The ways of thinking about chemistry, botany, etc., provide abstract concepts that can be used for us to talk about patterns.</span></p><p><span>NA: Patterns are abstractions... I know that in the policy world, they create products called "toolkits" which are solutions to certain community problems, like "you’re having high blood pressure a lot in this community... you might want to stick to healthy lifestyles, get exercise, get educated about this stuff."</span></p><p><span>JC: That’s another interesting example of the essence of a pattern, or the abstraction of a pattern living in a community.  Some communities might have the habit of brushing their teeth without realising that it’s healthy, or eating a lot of salt without realising it’s unhealthy.</span></p><p><span>LV: Habits that </span><em><span>survive</span></em><span> might be linked to “actual problems”?  Maybe the high blood pressure example generates a checklist (cf. their use in medicine), of things to check.  In a group, in a social setting, trying to think about problems... it’s not necessarily thinking about problems and antidotes, and </span><em><span>how they impact the future</span></em><span>, or </span><em><span>how to steer in a different direction</span></em><span>.  It can remove something, or maintain the status quo.  E.g., a trend of climate change will continue or worsen.  But we could look at social conversations about problems-as-opportunities-for-learning to do more than just apply an antidote.</span></p><p><span>NA: How do we anticipate a different future?  Remember "Disasterology", they were talking about how, because policy-makers failed to anticipate, we draw on fiction writers to thin about climate and so on.</span></p><p><span>LV: The different versions of a problem: why do people brush teeth... they get grimy? they fall out?  But with climate change, it’s wider, linked with a community; it’s not obviously individualisable.</span></p><p><span>JC: If it’s an individual context, e.g. “everyone should brush their teeth”, you get your typical mathematical set/context; but with anticipation patterns/contexts, it’s very different.</span></p><p><span>JC: The “Review the context phase” highlights the inherent transformative role of those patterns.  Niche-construction means that we could change the context through repeated practice.</span></p></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="par"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>PAR</span></span></h3><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-5"><h5 class="firn-headline firn-headline-5" id="1-establish-what-is-happening:-what-and-how-are-we-learning?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>1.
