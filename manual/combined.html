intelligence</span></em><span> is used almost everywhere, but artificial intelligence is
used almost nowhere.  AI can kick butt at Chess and Go, but university
courses are still taught by human professors.  Surely, AI that could
write code at a human level would be a valuable thing...</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="but-where’s-the-human-level-ai-for-coding?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>But where’s the human-level AI for coding?</span></span></h3><section><p><span>A research agenda around “AI for programming” was already spelled out
by Alan Turing in the late 1940s.  It is only relatively recently that
we have massive amounts of relevant data to work with.  Code
completion and code generation tools are some of the “low hanging
fruit” of this domain.  We think that something much more substantial
is around the corner.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="we-are-looking-at-this-problem-as-an-informal-open-source-r&amp;d-collective"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>We are looking at this problem as an informal open source R&D collective.</span></span></h3><section><p><span>Our loose-knit team brings together applied experience in Natural Language
Processing (NLP), computational modelling, online communities,
mathematical sciences ($x!$) as well as humanities and social science.  We’ve been getting
together for daily coffee chats, and sharing information and skills
with each other in online seminars.  Sometimes we bring in guest
speakers.  We hope as time goes by our chats will coalesce into notes,
blog posts, papers, and working prototypes.  We aren’t promising a
schedule of deliverables — because we’re all volunteers — and we’re
doing this for fun and interest.  But we do plan to share what we’re
learning as we go along!</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="broadly,-the-steps-we-have-in-mind-go-from-data,-to-models,-to-ai-agents"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Broadly, the steps we have in mind go from data, to models, to AI agents.</span></span></h3><section><p><span>We plan to document our progress (or lack thereof) on this blog.  As a
very rough outline, this is what we expect to look at:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>We plan to use contemporary information extraction methods to derive computationally meaningful material from Stack Exchange Q&A, Github Issues, and programmers’ discussions, along with code. To do this, we will combine general purpose language models, like BERT, and a knowledge graph approach.</span></p></li><li><p><span>We plan to use category theoretic methods as a glue that can hold together a range of computational models, including models of programs and the process of computer programming. </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.05691" target="_blank">Monocl</a><span> is an existing process modelling language that has been used to create an abstraction layer over a collection of </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://www.datascienceontology.org/" target="_blank">data science programs</a><span>. We plan to generalise this.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Ultimately, we plan to install these models in computational agents who can then “converse with each other to sharpen their wits,” as Turing anticipated, mirroring contemporary developments in self-play.  However, the specific design of the agents remains an open issue at the moment!  We plan to explore techniques from Bayesian learning, logic programming, and reinforcement learning.</span></p></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="reflection-is-part-of-the-process"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Reflection is part of the process.</span></span></h3><section><p><span>We’re interested in understanding human behaviour as well as technical
topics: that goes for our own behaviour in particular.  We plan to
post to our blog at least monthly — as long as we keep our discussion
running — using it as a place to reflect on how things are going.
Although we’re grappling with some weighty topics, success is not all
or nothing!  Writing here will mark our progress and be useful in
their own right (e.g., blog posts can feed into research papers or
tools).</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="progress-so-far"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Progress so far</span></span></h3><section><p><span>Alongside setting up a blog and drafting an initial anouncement
(voilà!), we’ve updated the website of our affiliated UK-based company</span><a class="firn-external" href="https://hyperreal.enterprises/" target="_blank">Hyperreal Enterprises</a><span> to match the outlines of what we’ve described
here.  As mentioned above, are having regular meetings, which we’ll
record if they look likely to be interesting to a wider audience.
We’ve got nice internal documentation going, via </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam" target="_blank">Org Roam</a><span>, from wich
various derived formats are produced, including a public </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://exp2exp.github.io/" target="_blank">wiki</a><span>

talk about the various other Emacs-based tools we’re using!)</span></p><p><span>Some of our seminars so far have explored an Open Information

advanced AI systems.  We expect that our stance on AI will not
necessarily be a popular one.  But this is an important “minor” strand
of AI research dating back to Alan Turing:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>"As time goes on the [computer] itself will take over the functions
both of [programmers] and of [users]…The [programmers] are liable to
get replaced because as soon as any technique becomes at all
stereotyped it becomes possible to devise a system of instruction
tables which will enable the electronic computer to do it for
itself. It may happen however that the [programmers] will refuse to do
this. They may be unwilling to let their jobs be stolen from them in
this way. In that case they would surround the whole of their work
with mystery and make excuses, couched in well chosen gibberish,
whenever any dangerous suggestions were made." -- Alan Turing, 1947.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>On average, advanced AI would bring in new ways of working, and would
facilitate broad access to high-quality training.  This agenda could
serve to focus the mind of technical workers, but not many are
pursuing it presently.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="motivation:-technical-experiments-become-easier"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Motivation: Technical experiments become easier</span></span></h2><section><p><span>Even in the present time, without relying on any speculative AI
futures to magically appear, we can benefit from pursuing the agenda
above.  Accordingly, we are doing some applied work with existing
software that will give us a set of further tools and levers to work
with.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="representative-prior-work"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Representative Prior Work</span></span></h2><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="planetmath"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>PlanetMath</span></span></h3><section><p><a class="firn-external" href="https://planetmath.org/" target="_blank">PlanetMath</a><span> users created a reasonably large informal mathematical
knowledge base together.  On the way, we came up with several
technical demos and sketched possible </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://github.com/holtzermann17/planetmath-docs/labels/PREVIEW" target="_blank">previews</a><span> for upcoming features.
One possible direction of work we looked at would be to focus on
building a comprehensive category theory knowledge base.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="modelling-the-way-mathematics-is-actually-done"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Modelling the way mathematics is actually done</span></span></h3><section><p><span>In </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://www.newton.ac.uk/files/preprints/ni17003.pdf" target="_blank">this paper</a><span>, we talked about how mathematics is situated somewhere
in between ‘games’ and ‘storytelling’ in its complexity.  We proposed
to build computational models of informal mathematical reasoning.
Subsequent work continued on in this direction, using ideas from</span><a class="firn-external" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370217300267" target="_blank">dialogue games</a><span> and </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10503-018-9474-x" target="_blank">argumentation theory more broadly</a><span>.</span></p></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="a-sketch-of-a-plan"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>A sketch of a plan</span></span></h2><section><p><span>So, having gotten together around these ideas, we’re having online
chat, frequent short meetings.  We’ve talked about maintaining a blog
that would describe what we’re learning and developing.  So, roughly
speaking, we will try to develop a curriculum through the blog.  We
also have this wiki, that any of us can edit, which we can use as a
staging ground for more developed blog posts.  Our thought was that
blog posts might move in the direction of more developed outputs,
whether products or research papers.  We want to use some ideas
adapted from Scrum to build a shared awareness of what’s going on.
However, we want to be careful not to become “managerial” since
everyone is currently here as a volunteer, working on topics of his or
her own interest.  We want to provide mutual support and fun.
Reflection, whether in writing, or by recording and listening again to
conversations, should help with that.  We are not constraining things
to come out in a purely structured curriculum, or any other form of
product development.  “Users” and “customers” may appear as we release
things we are happy with and expand our little community.</span></p><blockquote><p><span>“Rousseau says, someone who has been properly educated will be engaged
in society, but relate to his or her fellow citizens in a natural way.

preservation and interests.  By contrast, </span><em><span>amour-propre</span></em><span> is an unnatural
self-love that is essentially relational. ... Thus, </span><em><span>amour-propre</span></em><span> can

as an approximate unit of work.  Once we have amassed a few outputs
from this kind of effort, we will have some evidence of the kinds of
things that we can realistically achieve.  So far, our workflow has
been more based on solo activities and informal conversations, but
short robust team-ups continue to be an option!</span></p><blockquote><p><span>Hypothetical conversation: </span><em><span>In my next post I want to integrate something that I learned from you about PL.

detect errors in subtraction (reimplementing some classic work). We
were thinking that something similar could be used to detect other
kinds of errors (so, for debugging, teaching), and to support other
kinds of reasoning processes (e.g., turning Q’s into A’s in a
question-answering system).</span></p><p><span>We previously did a little exploratory work, with similar intent, using
polygraphs as input, in the workshop paper</span><em><span>Modelling the Way Mathematics Is Actually Done</span></em><span>.</span></p></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><h4 class="firn-headline firn-headline-4" id="demo-application:-reimplementing-classic-rules-to-model-subtraction"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Demo application: Reimplementing classic rules to model subtraction</span></span></h4><section><p><span>We looked at a classic paper about “subtraction on Mars” and it seems

basis for this work.  We would want to respect category theoretic
concepts in the presentation.  We would expect to find analogues in
settings like Bayesian modelling.</span></p><p><span>We could proceed by looking at relationships with argumentation
theory, thinking about how to do this in a theoretically consistent
way.  Once we have a definition of the programming language we’re
going to use, we can then do argumentation over that.</span></p><p><span>Another strategy would be to develop a DSL for HtDP ideas, which we
could then reuseq to generate patterns for learning how to design
various structures (say, web pages or probabilistic programs).  To do
this well you’d need ways to express ‘recipes’.  For example, an MVP
might be based on representing HtDP-style recipes using sequent
calculi for session types.  These represent interactive protocols.</span></p><p><span>You’d use cut-elimination to have two players interact (using
something like the </span><strong><strong><span>Lakatos Game diagram</span></strong></strong><span>).  But what formalism
would you use?  E.g., </span><em><span>geometry of interaction in linear logic</span></em><span> has
been used for this kind of thing, but could it be used here?  With a
suitable formalism in place we would then imagine that a computer
programming agent would just follow the “Lakatos Game” style HtDP
script.  So, this would contribute to the development of agent models
for programming and program-related Q&A.</span></p></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="related-work"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Related work</span></span></h3><section><ul><li><p><span>General theory-informed algorithms (e.g., apply category theory to scientific models).</span></p></li><li><p><span>K framework: Have transformations for any language you define in it.</span></p></li><li><p><span>HtDP is similar applied to programming teaching.

This recovers some of the Research Collab ideas developed by Aaron
Krowne. It should integrate features such as writing and task
management (e.g., </span><em><span>Org</span></em><span>) Program evaluation (e.g., </span><em><span>Maxima</span></em><span>),
Typesetting and presentation (e.g., slides via </span><em><span>LaTeX</span></em><span>), and
navigation (e.g., </span><em><span>Org Roam</span></em><span> for displaying topics as a graph).  We
should be clear that the various technologies used are slot-fillers
and they might be replaced with other things, or augmented (e.g.,</span><em><span>Lean</span></em><span> for formal verification of some of the above?). A useful input
to this process would be implementation of examples without
integration.  This can then be redone in a more integrated fashion.</span></p><p><span>An integration using existing technologies will have limitations, once
we have this demos then we will see some of the gaps and how more
advanced tech could be useful. (For example, Ray’s work with Gerschom

I don’t know if they practiced robust summarisation, either.)</span></p></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-17"><h6 class="firn-headline firn-headline-6" id="remark"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>REMARK</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#joe">joe</a></span></span></h6><section><p><span>This is an “inline task,” via </span><code>(require 'org-inlinetask)</code><span>.
