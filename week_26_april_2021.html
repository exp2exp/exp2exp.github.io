neuroscience inspired model of virtue ethics” has been shipped off in a final
camera-ready version.  It was almost entirely Nigel’s work, but I provided a
sounding board.  In addition, I helped flesh the paper out in directions that I’m
sure Nigel hadn’t anticipated — using some ideas and themes that I personally
hadn’t anticipated relying on in an academic setting!  </span><em><span>Viz.</span></em><span>, from the Discussion:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>One clear limitation of this work is that we have cleaved to certain “Western”
notions.  Fundamental parallels to Willard’s model may be found in some other
traditions (e.g., the four frames of reference [body, feelings, mind, and mental
qualities], together with the three path aggregates [virtue, concentration, and
discernment] in Buddhist practice theory, cf. Thannisaro Bhutto (2013, pp. </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/wings/part2.html#part2-b" target="_blank">74</a><span>, </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/wings/part3.html#part3-a" target="_blank">173</a><span>)):
but even more interesting for future work would be an elaboration of
cultural differences that this model does not capture.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>I’d been interested in ‘practice theory’: both with regard to </span><em><span>reading</span></em><span> </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Must_Change_Your_Life" target="_blank">Peter Sloterdijk</a><span>
and also with regard to </span><em><span>writing</span></em><span> in the </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://peeragogy.org/practice.html" target="_blank">Peeragogy Handbook</a><span> and elsewhere.
So I was glad that some of this started to make its way into my more formal writing,
even though I don’t know much about the themes of ‘theology’ and ‘neuroscience’ in the subtitle.</span></p><p><span>Also on the front of paper-writing, I polished off (at least to draft status)
another task that had been around for a long time: turning our HCI Ethics
‘treatment’ into a ‘storyboard’.  In plain language this means transforming a 7
page PDF into a set of around 75 slides, each one dealing with a significant point
from the short 7 page ‘treatment’.  I think a similar development strategy could
be useful for other papers: writing “outline → treatment → storyboard → paper”.
Along the way we also used Logseq to create a more extended version of the
treatment (I’m not sure that anything particularly valuable was actually ended up
in there!) alongside Slack which accumulated a big collection of links.  So these
resources start to give a set of references that can be added to the document.
the theme of “HCI Ethics” seems a bit connected with ‘practice theory’ as above,
and we’ve been trying to pay attention to thinking carefully about the tools and
practices we’ve used when writing these successive drafts.</span></p><p><span>Speaking of writing: over the past week I introduced a page here on Exp2Exp to
collect some more free-form </span><a class="firn-internal" href="https://exp2exp.github.io/Writing">Writing</a><span>, which — if I post frequently and regularly —
may be helpful (for me) as an alternative way to explore the themes we’ve been
talking about here in the wiki.  I’m also wondering if a </span><a class="firn-internal" href="https://exp2exp.github.io/writers_workshop">Writers Workshop</a><span> might be
worthwhile to add into the mix of shared activities, and I’ve aired that as a
possibility.</span></p><p><span>And, speaking of practice theory, I’ve started to use </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Tracking-your-habits.html" target="_blank">org-habit</a><span> to track a few new
habits that I’d like to get fully established in May:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Write 2 pages in the morning</span></p></li><li><p><span>Meditate in the morning</span></p></li><li><p><span>Jump rope 300 times</span></p></li><li><p><span>...</span></p></li><li><p><span>Meditate in the evening</span></p></li><li><p><span>Write 2 pages in the evening</span></p></li><li><p><span>22:00 Bedtime</span></p></li></ul><p><span>The ellipsis in the middle covers all the professional, personal, and
business (and, creative, etc.) things I’d </span><em><span>like</span></em><span> to be doing and which
clearly need some more development.  Some of the tasks I have slated
for the next week will unpack this further via some meta-reflection
stuff — doing some future-oriented thinking (in the top three
bullet-points here):</span></p><ul><li><p><span>What are some projects I should be working on at the six-month scale?</span></p></li><li><p><span>What are some projects I should be working on at the year scale?</span></p></li><li><p><span>What are some projects I should be working on at the year-and-a-half scale?</span></p></li><li><p><span>Out of my defined projects what’s the value I want to generate there?</span></p></li><li><p><span>Now that I have more Org Roams I should put the ones I actually use under version control</span></p></li><li><p><span>Drop email to DALT students</span></p></li><li><p><span>Review my journal from the first week</span></p></li><li><p><span>Review the peeragogy backlog to decide which things are wontfix, what other categories need to be created, etc.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Work some more on the ‘poem’ version of the handbook</span></p></li></ul></section></div></div><hr /><div class="back"><p>Back to blog: <a href="https://exp2exp.github.io/updates.html">Exp2Exp: Updates</a></p></div></article></main></body><script>anchors.options = {
