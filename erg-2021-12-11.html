so, further, I don’t come here to work, but come to partake in something but I don’t call this work</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Why did the checkins become longer?</span></p></li><li><p><span>We created more times to have chill-out sessions that last somewhat longer!</span></p></li><li><p><span>In PLACARD workshops it sounds more like "work" than friendliness, open communication.</span></p></li><li><p><span>So is this a case against checkins?  A dichotomy in which some people want to work, some want to be there?</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>RP: This isn’t a case against checkins, it’s a question of do we do them before or after we get to the agenda?</span></p></li><li><p><span>JC: Maybe it’s the responsibility of the chair to check in on behalf of the agenda?</span></p></li><li><p><span>RP: Maybe reserve free time for discussion towards the end?</span></p></li><li><p><span>LV: I like short checkin for 15 minutes (with small technical stuff) and social stuff?</span></p><ul><li><p><span>30 minutes to get started?  Well, we may need some time to prepare the room early.</span></p></li><li><p><span>RP: MAybe it will put you at ease to know: the question is, does it make sense to have an extension of coffee chat before we get into the agenda?</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>NA: The thing that made me feel thrown off was, within the 1hr meetings during the week, sometimes people will come from a different conversation, and that can take time out of the meeting.  It’s about the head-space of how the discussion moves along.  As for Saturday, I like the nice place to hang out and reflect, and that’s the goal for me for Saturday meetings, as a reflection on the week, what happened during the week, getting into the next week more refreshed.  Because we’re all working in different projects w/ different languages it can become confusing!</span></p></li><li><p><span>Does this apply to these meetings or the coffee chat?</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>Will organise meeting w/ LV for next week</span></p></li><li><p><span>Our next meeting for the year would be Saturday the 18th then take 2 weeks off, and come back on January 3rd?</span></p></li><li><p><span>JC: On moderation styles; it’s not just about moderating the </span><em><span>meetings</span></em><span>, but also about moderating the workflows</span></p></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="broader-moderation-towards-what?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Broader moderation towards what?</span></span></h3><section><ul><li><p><span>CLA, as ways to think about everything from the litany (immediate issues) to worldview or myth level (what are the deeper issues)</span></p></li><li><p><span>How does the meeting reflect our broader purposes...</span></p></li><li><p><span>What is the Saturday meeting?</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Reflect</span></p></li><li><p><span>Wind down,</span></p></li><li><p><span>Get ready</span></p></li><li><p><span>NA: If we had serious deadlines we could use it to work on that as well but would rather keep the week for work-work!</span></p></li><li><p><span>RP: OK, so this leads to a question about topic... to make sure e.g., coffee chats (reflection), workshops (work)...</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Let’s not barge into something else during the week that we had for something else</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>LP: As we’re working on the alchemy of the meetings... I would be willing to say, since Saturday happens to be the day when I can be there for 2h or 1h30m, please use me as a resource at this time.  From a vantage point of not being in the chair, I see other things.  I was chairing the EmacsConf meeting, but 80% involved in the discussion, 20% looking ahead at the agenda, trying to make sure that things are productive/friendly/good communication... so, let’s use the session for what we can mobilise during the discussion.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>What’s most satisfactory for LP: I’m good at looking at processes, so use me as a resource for this.
