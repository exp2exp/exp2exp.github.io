good about it. Probably slightly overdid things but that’s the nature
of the times we are living in.  As of 1 March I finally got around to
submitting the Intent to Submit form for my EPSRC proposal.  And I did
some more prep-work on the proposal using an old template that I had
first put together when I was at Goldsmiths and then, apparently, used
again when I was at Edinburgh.  So, I’ve had a bit of practice writing
these things, which is good.</span></p><p><span>The main activity over the week was preparing and then delivering a
talk at the Serendipity and Big Data symposium.  This was definitely
an interesting experience and I left with a bunch of ideas!</span></p><p><span>In a follow-up I told one of the facilitators, Wendy, that I would be
keen to have the Serendipity Society take a look at my next revision
of the “Modelling Serendipity” paper, towards the end of March.  That
gives me a little bit of social pressure to get something written up.</span></p><p><span>In fact there are lots of writing tasks on at the moment! I’ll want to
keep working on the grant proposal to get something to share around by
or before Friday March 5th, so that will be a big thing for this week.
I also told Charlie that I would try to get a ‘triplet stanzas
edition’ of the Peeragogy patterns written on the same timeline.
That’s all possible.</span></p><p><span>Following up on the work we did with Mark Dawson over the weekend, I
hope to attend a session of the M-x Research group to see what they
are all about.</span></p><p><span>I’m mildly concerned that one of the people from the Serendipity
Society meeting emailed me to tell me that he thought I was ‘spreading
my butter too thinly’.  Maybe he is right, though on reflection I’m a
bit reminded of Mara’s speeches to Gotama telling him to give up his
quest.  Nevertheless, it’s interesting to learn that the impression
one gets from </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://hyperreal.enterprises" target="_blank">hyperreal.enterprises</a><span> and other such papertrails is that
I’m too unfocused.</span></p><p><span>Various other personal reflections: I may end up wanting to move to
Oxford sometime so I started looking a bit (I’ll have a little nest
egg in the form of my payment for teaching and tutoring).  I’ve nearly
finished watching ML Street Talk Episode 38 and found it really
rewarding so far, but now it’s as if I need to schedule some time for
TV viewing!  To say nothing of reading books, which has fallen off
recently... hm, maybe I do have too much going on!</span></p><p><span>Hyperreal Enterprises: £1250 still burning a hole in our collective
pocket, which may be a good thing!  One question with revisiting in
light of the discussion from </span><a class="firn-internal" href="https://exp2exp.github.io/erg-27-02-2021">27 February 2021 — Emacs Research Group</a><span>
is: ‘how much would people pay for continuous service uptime?’</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="week-ahead-tasks"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Week ahead tasks</span></span></h1><section><ul><li><p><span>Grant refinements</span></p></li><li><p><span>Triplet stanzas</span></p></li><li><p><span>Filling in my time sheets to collect some money for teaching!</span></p></li><li><p><span>Going over the course notes on random sampling to finalise those</span></p></li><li><p><span>Thinking about how to move to the next phase with the HCI Ethics paper (Reading Group presentation, and then, probably, a detailed outline or ‘storyboard’)</span></p></li></ul></section></div></div></div><hr /><div class="back"><p>Back to blog: <a href="https://exp2exp.github.io/updates.html">Exp2Exp: Updates</a></p></div></article></main></body></html>
