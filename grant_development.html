they honestly admit this in the paper! This was my stopping point with
the jupyter notebook as well i believe, I would like to get the neural
model to "ace" that part of the job before moving further. [...]  ok,
so after watching the entire review, I can conclude if I arrive at a
reliably successful method following my initial notebooks, and apply
them to arXiv and/or SE there's certainly a paper in there. Their
suggestions from the paper aren't actually that useful sadly, just
confirming some basic practical tricks (using last attention layer,
constraining with beam search and using language priors for the triple
content) that were already known</span></p></blockquote></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="&quot;mining-informal-proof-structure&quot;"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>"Mining informal proof structure"</span></span></h2><section><p><span>This would be a somewhat similar line of work but more along the lines
