research in the humanities and social sciences, to further our
understanding of global order and disorder. Research may be
problem-focused, creatively innovative and exploratory, and should
bring together relevant disciplines in the humanities and social
sciences, where appropriate, for maximum impact/effect. The Academy
expects all applications to fundamentally involve and integrate both
the humanities and social sciences. The Academy particularly encourage
applications led from the humanities.</span></p><p><span>The Academy is interested in projects of an interdisciplinary nature
that go beyond the day-to-day matters that this theme might engender,
and instead focus on the deeper and more long-term issues of global
(dis)order.
