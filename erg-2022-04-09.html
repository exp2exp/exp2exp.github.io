reflect on what we did during the meeting, and sometimes allows us to
formulate perspectives that weren’t surfaced during the meeting.  More recently,
we realised that the first question of the Project Action Review

should be engaged with as a meta-point, early in the session.  Broadly
the PAR helps us cultivate a sense of shared mindfulness about what

complex understanding of ‘patterns’.  Our methods allow us to
establish a high-level view for surfacing patterns.  We also
understand ‘patterns’ as not always complete: they can also be
‘projects’.  Design patterns have an orientation towards scaffolding
action!  The distilled data from logged </span><a href="#*-meeting-review"></a><span> and [[* Meeting

information and workflow management.  As our collaborator Abby Tabor
summarises the motivations for establishing a link between design
patterns and the theory of Active Inference:</span></p><p><span>\begin{quote}\emph{“Each problem-system will be described as a pattern, setting out the evidence and hypothesis for resolution.  Each pattern is itself evolving over time, shaped by new findings; contextual, specific to the problem at hand, evidence-based and related to other patterns; and communicable, both teaching and learning for users of multiple disciplines.”}

(using the methods ourselves) as well as attempting to structure some

for clients and participants.  This can be put in more defined terms
by looking at the scenarios that are explored, and how this creates
the potential for skilled practice that can overcome real
difficulties.</span></p><p><span>Part of a strategy for generating stakeholder value include relying on
any attendees (whether guests or ourselves) as experts; this is a good
reason to </span><strong><span>Prepare questions</span></strong><span> </span><a href="#*-prepare-questions"></a><span> in advance of the
meeting, so that we surface that expertise.  Another aspect of this is
that our shared expertise is on supporting </span><strong><span>Deep engagement</span></strong><span> [[* Deep
engagement]]; this shouldn’t mean shoe-horning participants into roles
that are awkward for them, but rather, using our methods to help
understand how they are engaging and to amplify that.</span></p><p><span>It is often enough for us to enjoy a creative chat as per </span><strong><span>Seasons and
cycles</span></strong><span> </span><a href="#*-seasons-and-cycles"></a><span>; and while other stakeholders can get
something out of that, they may need more substantial take-aways
(particularly if they don’t plan to keep coming to these sessions).
Much as the </span><strong><span>Humane agenda</span></strong><span> </span><a href="#*-humane-agenda"></a><span> pattern describes how our
patterns work at the level of an individual meeting, a longer project
roadmap shows how we generate value on the larger scale, and something
also about the specificity of our approach.  Further detail follows in
the </span><a href="#*-example-placard-roadmap-for-abby-tabor-(uwe)">Example PLACARD roadmap for Abby Tabor (UWE)</a><span>, showing how we think
about value-creation in our first paid contract.  For now, here is a
quick sketch of how the major deliverables map to patterns.</span></p></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><h4 class="firn-headline firn-headline-4" id="research-&amp;-development-for-rapid-problem-solving-workshop"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Research & Development for rapid problem solving workshop</span></span></h4><section><p><span>Broadly, aligning on patterns as a method will help make things
coherent across the lifecycle of the project (</span><strong><span>Look for patterns</span></strong><span> [[* Look
for patterns]]).  If we need new patterns to solve the problems of
attendees—which is likely, since urban policy experts aren’t the same
crowd as Emacs enthusiasts—we can start by writing them down here!
That said, there are lots of existing patterns that are directly aimed
at urban policy, so we can potentially remix some of that material.
For our own in-house purposes we will need both ‘workshop patterns’
and ‘wiki patterns’.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><h4 class="firn-headline firn-headline-4" id="technological-implementation-of-the-wiki-prototype"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Technological implementation of the wiki prototype</span></span></h4><section><p><span>This relates to the </span><strong><span>Focus on methods</span></strong><span> </span><a href="#*-focus-on-methods"></a><span>, insofar as
the a crystalized form of a method is a technical implementation of
that method or workflow.  Patterns should help solve some problem, so
we should keep track of the problems that we’re actually trying to
solve as we go (using new patterns).  Since we have both our own
content and some other CC-licensed content to start with, we now have
some reasonable starting material to play with.  We also have some
ideas about more advanced features that we could incorporate in
subsequent prototypes.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><h4 class="firn-headline firn-headline-4" id="workshop-with-architects,-designers-and-urban-planners-in-bristol"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Workshop with architects, designers and urban planners in Bristol</span></span></h4><section><p><span>This relates to our plan to </span><strong><span>Bootstrap through mini-pilots</span></strong><span> [[* Bootstrap

idea of doing some play-testing with ourselves or with friends before
we get there seems wise.
