\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Introduction}

For this workshop design, we draw on Causal Layered Analysis
methods[fn:: fullcite:futuribles] to bring together a group of people
who haven’t worked together before, get them onto the same page, and
scaffold collaborative action.

We want our methods to be transferable between contexts.  Topics we’re
currently exploring include /public space/, /anticipatory methods/, and
/the future of free software/.  We envision these topics eventually
weaving together around larger and longer scale collaboration around
massive problems.

Our workshop has three phases, and ideally we would have several hours
to run it, though with adaptations it can be run in less than an hour.

** Phase One

In the first phase of the workshop we build a shared understand the
context and relationships that exist in that context.  We use
interactive activities to scaffold the process.  The result will be a
set of *scenarios* and *dimensions*.

** Phase Two

The second phase of the workshop, we ask participants to take on roles
that explore the scenarios.  Our aim is to create an *orientation to
action* that will outlive the workshop itself.

** Phase Three: The future

The workshop will have both a local and potentially a global legacy,
e.g.,
- Potentially morphing into a place-based collaborative space, like a “carpentry workshop” or “bicycle workshop”; and, furthermore,
- Local sites may link up to become part of a broader movement.

** Summary of Methods

- [ ] *Causal Layered Analysis.*  In both phases of the workshop we think in terms of CLA’s four layers: Litany, System, Worldview, and Myth.  In Phase 1, the output of each preceeding layers feeds into the next one; when we get to the Myths later, we have a shared perspective.  We then work our way back through the previous layers in the second phase of the workshop, envisioning a new Litany (e.g., future newspaper headlines).
- [ ] *Design Patterns.* The defined sets of problems that participants are used to solving comprise a simple ‘design pattern language’.  /Prior to the workshop/: we should do some background research on participants to develop hypotheses about what their patterns might look like.  *(This is especially important as a way to bring in themes, approaches, and hypotheses that are important to the workshop sponsors!)* /During the workshop/: we will refactor these patterns to bring about new ways of working.
- [ ] *Project Action Review.*  In this setting we want to ask people to imagine /future actions/, with attention to unexpected perturbations and variations (e.g., what can go wrong, what they might have to learn, things they might need to make, etc.).

Further details are available in a separate preprint.[fn::
fullcite:patterns-of-patterns] We’ve distilled the main things that
participants will need to know into several short handbooks, included
here as Appendices [[analyst]], [[historian]], [[kaiju]], and [[designer]].)  Indeed,
partipants will only need to familiarize themselves with one of these,
and we can do that during the workshop itself.

** Related work

Our methods, derive from experience with the Peeragogy project, particularly our use of design patterns, project action reviews, and short trainings for multiple roles.[fn:: fullcite:peeragogy-handbook]  Although the specific methodological synthesis is unique, we are not the only people working on related topics.  Here we limit ourselves to a few examples:

- [[https://earthwatch.org/][Earthwatch]] — “connects people with scientists worldwide to conduct
  environmental research and empowers them with the knowledge they
  need to conserve the planet.”
- [[https://doughnuteconomics.org/about-doughnut-economics][Doughnut Economics]] — “the Doughnut offers a vision of what it means
  for humanity to thrive in the 21st century - and Doughnut Economics
  explores the mindset and ways of thinking needed to get us there.”
  More specifically: “The social foundation forms an inner boundary,
  below which are many dimensions of human deprivation. The
  environmental ceiling forms an outer boundary, beyond which are many
  dimensions of environmental degradation.”

Like the proponents of these efforts, we are steeped in the values of
citizen science and open research.j  We also believe that our methods
can scaffold complex interactions between citizens and experts, to
achieve more integrated action than traditional conservation and
development projects.  Thus, we can help to further and consolidate
the aims of projects like the above.

Nevertheless, we should be clear that this point of view is currently
somewhat speculative.  Each of our patterns represents a hypothesis
that can be tested in practice and refined.  This document is an
evolving record of that process.

As mentioned, the workshop organizers should do some background
research on project participants and prepare some simple design
pattern descriptions based on their public profiles.  We can make use
an analogy between this four-part adaptation of the pattern template:
#+begin_quote
Problem ... Solution ... Rationale ... Actions ...
#+end_quote
and the four CLA layers to frame the patterns.

Our client for the public space workshop, Abby Tabor, suggested three
themes, which we've translated into patterns and immediate next steps,
using the DPL template.  We also have developed some patterns in
advance of our Anticipation 2022 workshop, which play a similar role
in that context.  These patterns presented in the subsections below as
indicative examples.  Further brief examples of patterns can be found
in the Designer Handbook, Appendix [[designer]].
** Example: “Public Space as Public Health”

*** Disorder :: Creating conditions in which adaptative systems learn over time
**** Problem
People tend to live in their own worlds, comfortable with their
abilities and limitations. However, when they encounter something
shocking they have trouble reacting appropriately.

**** Solution
Sennett suggests that human environments should be designed so that
people encounter difference.[fn:: fullcite:sennett2022designing] This
enhances our repertoires for thinking about things in complexity.

**** Rationale
This pattern can be used when we're thinking about designing cities
(e.g., at the level of an exposed, reusable infrastructure) but it can
also be used when designing other human interaction scenarios.

**** Actions
- [ ] In our workshop design, we want to create "wrinkles" for participants
by getting them not only to encounter difference, but also to purturb
their familiar environments.
- [ ] We'll do this by stripping expertise in our descent to the myth layer, and also:
- [ ] By adding disruptions to scenarios via the Kaij Communicator role.
- [ ] However, we don't want to overwhelm participants with too much responsibility while we're going through this process, so:
- [ ] We'll make our interfaces simple to use.
- [ ] We may add a Scribe role (filled by a facilitator) so that participants don't have to practice yet another skill while they think about the kinds of disorder that we want to expose them to.
- [ ] We'll aim to assess the outcomes of these design choices following a couple pilots before running the full workshop.

*** The Natural Contract :: A reconsideration of our relationship with our environment
**** Problem
The social contract is said to describe an implicit agreement that
allowed humans to form collectivities, leaving a state of nature. This
‘nature’ is presumed to accord with human reason. /And yet/, the limits
of this Enlightenment philosophy have become clear, in light of the
effects of modern human life on the globe.

**** Solution
Michel Serres proposes an alternative pact with nature that is no
longer parasitic, but symbiotic.[fn:: fullcite:serres1995natural] This
requires thinking in wholes, and in closed circuits: "by natural
contract above all the precisely metaphysical recognition, by each
collectivity, that it lives and works in the same global world as all
the others" @@latex:(p.~46).@@

**** Rationale
This perspective is friendly with cybernetics, although cybernetics
may not have the final word on the kinds of creative breakthroughs
that are needed to bring about needed change.[fn::
fullcite:Bardin2022] Furthermore, it may be difficult to engage with
‘nature’ in the way that Serres asks us to, given our tendency to
think in terms of socially meaningful symbols.  However, this pattern
provides something like a compass direction: whether we use it for
steering or for something else is up to us.

**** Actions

- [ ] One of our hopes is to invite new forms of action by mashing up the `patterns' that folks in different disciplines will already be familiar with, to produce new forms of action.
- [ ]  We should be careful to look at the relationship between `symbolic' action (e.g., actions that could justifiably tagged as "greenwashing") and actions that lead to new forms of life (e.g., ERG talks about "the ship that builds itself", which itself builds on other ship metaphors, such as the /polis/-as-ship for the Ancient Greeks).
- [ ]  Think about Ingold's perspective on lines themselves as important for correspondence between the evolving nodes (e.g., tube lines, bus routes); relevant to `salience' & capturing the communication between the nodes

*** Dissolving boundaries :: Between self and environment
**** Problem
Life in modern democracies is often characterised by shrink-wrapped food, waste that is taken away automatically, and exercise in gyms or yoga studios.  We often see the environment as something to consume, rather than as something that we live in symbiosis with.  /However/, despite the many benefits of modern living, some of its patterns are associated with poor health outcomes.
**** Solution
Life tends to cross boundaries in a complex web.  Social structures
also change how we think about boundaries: forexample, consider the
2003 Land Reform Act in Scotland, which allows camping anywhere.  When
we dissolve boundaries between elements of the environment, we see
things in a new way and can encourage the health of the whole.
**** Rationale
To see ourselves as part of a greater whole is step towards radical
action.  Everyone has access to a way experiencing the world in which
"We stop imputing the sense of solidity that creates a sense of
separation [and yet] do not shut off the senses in any way. Actually,
we shed the veneer, the films of confusion, of opinion, of judgment,
of our conditioning, so that we can see the way things really
are"[fn:: fullcite:amaro] @@latex:(p.~66).@@ This necessarily happens
"interfaced with the phenomenal world" @@latex:(\emph{ibid.},
p.~71).@@ Living creatures have a tendency to be biased towards
precise information, even if this information isn’t true.  Dissolving
boundaries can allow more holistic informative patterns to take shape.
Nevertheless, care should be taken not to dissolve the self into
unwholesome relational systems.
**** Actions
- [ ] We want to be careful not to overwhelm participants; use "wrinkles" that are, nevertheless within participants' zone of progress.
- [ ] Following the workshop, we want people to be more aware of the ramifications of their actions.

** Example: “Anticipating Anticipation”

*** Open Future Design

**** Problem
People need to coordinate, plan, and maintain social cohesion. If a culture can develop based on shared learning BUT there is no oracle that can tell us what to expect
**** Solution
Use design pattern methods to articulate multiple futures. This can co-evolve with further patterns, e.g., developing:
- a language for projects → Roadmap (Corneli et al, 2015), (…)
- a language of roles → Play to Anticipate the Future, (…)
- a language of future scenarios → (…)
**** Rationale
Examples include this pattern and Play to Anticipate the Future.

**** Actions
- [ ] Flesh out this pattern language.

*** Play to Anticipate the Future
<<play-to-anticipate-the-future>>

**** Problem
You are engaging with friends, colleagues or acquaintances. If you want to explore possible futures BUT time travel does not exist;
**** Solution
Play a game that lets you experience a plausible future scenario together.
**** Rationale
Example: A bipartisan group played a scenario planning game to anticipate the aftermath of a contested US election (Bidgood, 2020).
**** Actions:
- [ ] Transform our scripted presentation for Anticipation 2019 into a game; cf. https://fearlessjourney.info/.

* Scenario building activities

** /Before the workshop to Litany/



#+begin_quote
\noindent *Solo Activity:* *Dérive Comix* (2 hours max)

Walk for one hour around your neighbourhood.  Address some or all of
the following questions, possibly documenting them with photos, text,
or video clips.

What are you observing (sight, sound, smell)?  What are the obvious
things?  What are the sites of meaning, e.g., a bowl that is more than
just ‘a bowl’?  Where is meaning made unclear or fragmented?  What are
you experiencing (feelings, thoughts, first impressions)?  How have
things changed?  (It’s OK to get lost, but if you’re feeling lost when
reading these instructions, you may want to read this short intro to
the [[https://www.publicstreet.org/derive][dérive]].)

Follow up by preparing your materials to share in a succinct fashion,
e.g., as slides, sketches, a zine, a map, or some PostIt notes.

# - What are you observing? (sight, sound, smell)
# - What do we /already/ see? (What are the obvious things? What are the particular sites of meaning, e.g., a bowl that is more than just ‘a bowl’?)
# - What are you experiencing? (feelings, thoughts, first impressions)
# - Make a timeline of your experiences on the walk.

# - *UPGRADE*: The Celts pray using the every day (such as making a fire or milking a cow); they don’t separate time for prayer and time for life.  In a faith perspective, this is an incarnational model (God in flesh).

*** /Litany to Systems/

#+begin_quote
*Small Group Activity:* *Find the dots*

Join together with other workshop participants in small groups to
share your results from the previous activity, and cluster the themes
that you find there.
#+end_quote

# - Thinking about the stories; finding the ‘dots’ in the litany, and start to connect them in the systems.

**** Systems

#+BEGIN_JUSTIFYRIGHT
"'Who are you?' said the Caterpillar."[fn:: fullcite:alice]
#+END_JUSTIFYRIGHT

#+begin_quote
*Solo/Pair Activity:* *Advice from a Caterpillar*

Reflect on your observations, and use them to describe your
perspective.  You might comment on aspects of your values,
professional training, and life experiences that led you to make the
observations you did, as well as the direct circumstances that
contributed to shaping your experience.
#+end_quote


# - What systems/factors/actors bring about these observations and experiences?
# - Who do you think is involved in the /decisions/ that shaped your environment?

***** /Systems to Worldview/

#+begin_quote
\noindent *Small Group Activity:* *Map-making*

Return to your small groups and bring together the themes you
identified earlier.  Informed by your reflections, work together with
the group to arrange the information on a map.  Notice that since
people navigated different physical locations, your ‘map’ is likely to
be somewhat abstract.  Where it makes sense, the map should record
different perspectives from people in the group.  For example, the
older people might perceive the place they explored to be a village,
while younger people perceive it to be a settlement on the outskirts
of town.  You might have different perspectives on what’s missing.
Try to articulate such complexities.
#+end_quote

# - How would you represent this information on a map?  How would you visualize it?  How would you explain it to others?
# - (E.g., /our/ worldview is probably already summed up in the diagram that LV drew, showing the inputs, process, and outputs of the workshop.)

# - E.g., Hypotheses about Kennington, Oxfordshire: the older people perceive the place as a village, younger people perceive it as a settlement on the outskirts of Oxford.  Older people might perceive what’s missing and also what’s new.

****** Worldview

#+begin_quote
*Small Group Activity:* *Problem identification*

Working together with the small group, talk about any problems you
noticed.  How does the map represent stressful or concerning
experiences?  What are some alternative histories or alternative
futures that would describe how the circumstances would have changed?
#+end_quote

# - What do you want to have happened?  What would you like to have happen in the future?

******* /Worldview to Myths/

#+begin_quote
*Full Group Activity:* *Dimension analysis*

Coming back together with the full group, arrange the maps you created
across a set of dimensions.  Two dimensions would be traditional:
creating a 2-by-2 grid with "best" in the upper right, "worst" in the
lower left, and so on — but feel free to use as many dimensions as you
wish.  For example, it could be helpful to use the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Basic_Human_Values][Theory of Basic
Human Values]] to organise the scenarios.
#+end_quote

# - From maps to myths.

******** Myths

#+begin_quote
*Full Group Activity:* *Scenarios*

Working together with the full group, use the dimensions you created
in the previous activities (together with the maps and stories) to
give descriptive names to some scenarios for the future.  These should
sum up the map(s) in each quadrant (or more generally, segment) from
the diagrammatic analysis.

The goal here to run something akin to an inception.  Our preliminary
postulate is that, if people could change things on their own, they
would have done it already, or work would at least be in progress.
Our goal therefore is to challenge their views, so that they leave the
workshop with a modified understanding of how the world works
(including the myths that motivate them, but more broadly with the
ability to orchestrate complex change).

Here we introduce four roles.  The attendees are broken into four
corresponding groups, each to be given a short training.  Then
participants will be put into teams of four, with one person from each
role in every team.

\colorlet{shadecolor}{aqua!40}

 come to be realised or avoided.

Our hope is that partipants will be ready for new forms of action after this workshop.  We’re prepared to offer support with tooling and other next steps.

From our side, by running this process in a lot of different spaces, we hope to get a big picture view on how people’s different maps and myths fit together, potentially helping people address bigger problems.

But, again, there are plenty of hypotheses to test out at this level.

Here are some notes about how technology can potentially help people manage actions.

** Introduction to Causal Layered Analysis
:PROPERTIES:
:UNNUMBERED: t
:END:

<<CLA_patterns>>

Sohail Inayatullah developed Causal Layered Analysis (CLA) as a
research methodology for examining a topic of concern at four layers
that he refers to as the /litany/, /system/, /worldview/ and /myth/.  In
developing a CLA, none of the four layers is privileged over the
others, nor are they examined in isolation.  Rather, one moves between
them, examining how they relate to one another.  One can then
integrate these insights to form a more comprehensive basis for
understanding what is happening in the present and for anticipating
the future.  The sections below begin by describing each of the four
layers according to the following schema:

- *Contents*: /What is found in this layer?/
- *Analysis*: /Techniques for analysis of this layer./
- *Literature*: /Instances of texts which are typically operative at this layer./

The sections then proceed by developing a running example, to further
illustrate the four layers and show how such an analysis might
proceed.  We conclude with some further discussion and an example of
the kind of tableau that an Analyst might develop in the *Back to
reality* exercise ([[worldview-to-systems]]).

\noindent *Example:* Gasp! An Evil Genius has occupied the Ashmolean museum.  All
entrances are barred shut, no-one can get in or out.  For a few weeks
this persists---despite efforts at blockading the premises and
shutting off utilities, somehow the occupiers are not being starved
out and are not letting up.  The press and the authorities are baffled
as how and why this is going on!  It seems that the occupiers are not
interested in making public statements or demanding ransom or anything
of the sort---apparently all they want to do is to have the museum to
themselves and camp out there.  After a few week, documents from the
museum and detailed plans and images of artefacts from the museum
circulate on the web and museum-quality replicas of artefacts from the
Ashmolean appear in third-world countries.

*** System

- Contents   :: The social, economic, political, and historical forces which shape events.
- Analysis   :: Technical explanations and interpretation of data within a given paradigm.
- Literature :: Editorials and policy institute reports.

\noindent *Example:* Advances in scanning and printing technology make it possible to
produce copies of artefacts indistinguishable form the original.
Moreover, since the information is stored and transmitted digitally,
anyone with a suitable printer anywhere can make themselves a copy.  A
system of tunnels allowed the occupiers to evade the blockade and keep
themselves supplied.  The security system originally designed to keep
terrorists from damaging the priceless treasures was instead used to
protect the "terrorists" against the "authorities" "besieging" the
museum.

*** Worldview

- Contents :: Core values and attitudes which motivate choices and actions.
- Analysis :: Uncover deep assumptions and study the mental and linguistic constructs which undergird how people interact with each other and their surroundings.  Compare and critique paradigms and discourses.
- Literature :: Works of philosophy and critical theory.

\noindent *Example:* At the bottom of this scenario, there is a clash of
worldviews. “What is an artefact?”: Is it an object which plays a role
in rituals and gift networks?  Is it a source of data for scientific
investigations of the past?  Is it a part of an artistic and cultural
heritage?  Who should own the artefact: The heirs of the people who
originally made it?  Those with the power and wealth to acquire it?
Those who have the facilities to curate and study it?  Where is the
value: Is it spritual?  Is it social?  Is it economic?  Is it
scientific?  Is it artistic?  Does it specially inhere in the original
or can a copy share in the value under certain circumstances?

*** Myth

- Contents :: The symbols and tales which give meaning to life.
- Analysis  :: Study symbols and narratives, and the myths and rituals within which they participate.
- Literature :: Poetry, art, anthropology, Jungian analysis.

\noindent *Example:* In this setting, there is a corresponding clash/clang of
myths.  We have the myths of the people who made the artefact and the
metaphors which it expressed for them.  We have the "manifest destiny"
and "white man's burden" myths of the colonizers who collected the
artefacts and sent them to the museum.  We have the more secular myths
of people who admire, study and care for the artefacts in the museum
today, treasuring them as expressions of the human spirit which
continue to serve as a source of meaning and inspiration.

** Applying CLA thinking to critiquing the Cooling the Commons patterns
:PROPERTIES:
:UNNUMBERED: t
:END:


The 41 patterns developed by the ‘Cooling the Commons’ initiative
include examples like \textsc{The Night-Time Commons}, which:

#+begin_quote
… might shift daytime activities into cooler night times. Some places
already have these patterns: night markets and night-time use of
outdoor spaces. If locally adapted versions of these patterns
encourage people to adopt new habits, other patterns will be
needed. These will include, for example, ways to remind those cooling
off outdoors in the evening that others might be trying to sleep with
their naturally ventilating windows open. Such interlinked patterns
point to the way pattern thinking moves from the big scale to the
small.
#+end_quote

Reading this, we were concerned that, while the Cooling the Commons
patterns do acknowledge “horizontal complexity”—namely, through
interlinked patterns—the process does not deal with the “vertical
complexity” coming from the fact that diurnal rhythms are deeply
embedded in biology and culture. People have cultural beliefs about
the activities that are appropriate for different times of day. Public
and domestic rituals are organized about the daily cycle. Times of day
have symbolic associations. As far as we could tell, these authors
focused on more or less technical issues at the systems level, and did
not acknowledge these issues at the worldview and myth levels. A more
comprehensive approach might, for instance, re-examine rituals to see
which of them relate to the phenomenon of sunrise versus the act of
getting up and starting the day, and then figuring out how to adapt
these rituals to a new schedule. A suitable research strategy might be
to study how practices changed in the past, as with the introduction
of industrialization and its clockwork regimentation of the day.

# ** Pathway to Radical Startups Finland 2050
# #+begin_quote
# In the Radical Startups scenario society is business-oriented, but
# economy is driven by a multitude of small-scale startups known for
# their radical values and approaches.  Peer-to-peer is realised in
# startup networks. Their selling point is promising to do societal and
# environmental good, and offering workers opportunities for
# self-expression.  Environmental problems are solved first and foremost
# commercially.  Businesses are drivers of new, deep-ecologically
# oriented lifestyles.
# #+end_quote
# *** 2015
# Austerity polices of the new government and Western sections of Russia deepen the recession in Finland.
# *** 2019
# Liberal parties win the elections of 2019. The Green Party and the National Coalition Party form the backbone of the new government.
# *** 2020
# Open source becomes increasingly prominent as a business model. Finnish startups become forerunners of open source practices.
# *** 2021
# The government defines ecosystems of startups, especially cleantech and environmental businesses, as the new backbone of the Finnish economy.
# *** 2025
# The goal is set that Finland would become carbon-neutral by 2050. Road tolls are introduced. Business funding is modified to enable startups taking more risks. Social security is renewed to support startup entrepreneurs after failure.
# *** 2030
# A new culture of experiments emerges. Finland opens to the rest of the world, especially due to translation technologies which have made language barriers obsolete.
# *** 2035
# Finland’s traditional very narrow production structure is diversified significantly. Services, ICT, cleantech and the cultural sector become the new economic leaders.
# *** 2040
# The emphasis on pragmatism and engineer-like rationalism has stepped aside to give room for more value-oriented approaches. Following the example of startups, values of deep ecology have penetrated throughout the Finnish culture.
# *** 2045
# Inequality and work-related stress have increased. People find it hard to wind down or do things for their own purpose, without calculating the profit for business and work. Public schools have almost disappeared; private schools and self-learning communities provide education. Rural areas have become desolate. Most finns live in large cities.
# *** 2050
# The new business environment has matured, and the state has stepped out of the way to leave businesses to operate on their own. Finland has become more or less a libertarian state, as have most other countries.


# ** Pathway to Value-Driven Techemonths Finland 2050
# #+begin_quote
# In the Value-Driven Techemoths scenario, peer-to-peer approaches are
# common, but they are practiced within large technology
# corporations. These “techemoths” represent the Silicon Valley vision
# of emancipation, freedom, creativity and open source.  The vision is,
# however, somewhat self-contradictory. Techemoths cherish the
# “libertarian” hacker ethos, but at the same time confine their
# employees tightly within corporate walls.  In this scenario, markets
# take care of environmental issues. Techemoths invest in ambitious
# energy, technology and environmental projects.
# #+end_quote
# *** 2015
# Elon Musk established a private school for Space X employees, representing one of the first moves towards community-like companies.
# *** 2017
# Finnish companies began to look for new organization models. They were especially attracetd by the experiments of Google, Facebook and other technology behemoths.
# *** 2020
# The first Finnish techemoth was established out of the small and medium-sized companies of the company ecosystem formed around Nokia.
# *** 2021
# Many Finnish companies turned to techemoth organization models. The lives of many Finns began to revolve around their workplaces.
# *** 2025
# Engineer-minded HR management proved disfunctional in techemoth settings. Management was to be rethought.
# *** 2030
# Little by little the Finnish management culture became more democratic. Employees were given more power than they were used to. Cooperative-like practices were implemented in most of the Finnish techemoths.
# *** 2040
# Conflicts between techemoths and society begin to emerge. Companies, especially international ones, are so powerful that their interests often clash with the interests of the general public.
# *** 2045
# Techemoths’ large resources have enabled the transition to a sustainable society and renewable energy system, but the problem is that energy solutions are tied to the companies providig them.
# *** 2050
# Inequalities have widened between those employed by techemonths and those working and living outside them. The well-off are more informed on energy and environmental issues, and are able to make smarter and "cooler" choices on energy and the environment.

#+begin_quote
The world has faced an ecological collapse.  Engineer-oriented
citizens have organized themselves as local communities to survive.
Environmental problems are solved locally, with a practical mindset.
Nation states and national cultures have more or less withered away.
Global trade has plummeted, so communities have to cope with mostly
low-tech solutions.
#+end_quote

*** 2015
The first dramatic effects of climate change are seen in the Western
countries. In Finland, the effects are not yet really visibly felt,
but preparing for the changing climate is taken more seriously than
before.
*** 2017
The Finnish government led by the Center Party invests in bio economy,
creating jobs all around the country.
*** 2020
Education, especially that of engineers, is steered towards the bio
economy and sustainable solutions. Digital services are used
increasingly to enable collaboration and distributed practices.
*** 2021
Traditional wood and paper industry has transformed into a
biomaterials industry. Almost everything can be manufactured with
biomaterials.
*** 2025
Local economies and communities thrive once again in every nook and
cranny of Finland. The warming climate is beneficial for the bio
economy, as growing seasons are longer than before.
*** 2030
Warming climate causes unrest across the globe. Finns become
increasingly isolated and try to stay away from global conflicts. A
survivalist mentality gains ground, and local communities try to
become self-sufficient.
*** 2035
People start to migrate away from Southern Finland to the inland.
*** 2040
Finns live mostly in self-sufficient small cities and communities and are well-prepared for whatever the global situation might turn into. Unemployment is rare, which eases social tensions and frees resources.
*** 2045
In Finland the pull towards self-sufficient communities is lifestyle- and value-driven, whereas in many parts of the world tight communities are necessary for surviving climate change. While elsewhere localisation of communities often leads to isolation and fragmentation, the Finns still share a common national identity.
*** 2050
The isolation of Finland proves in more and more occasions a two-sided sword. As the global situation becomes increasingly chaotic, allies across borders are welcomed warmly. New global order begins to emerge, but Finland continues its cosy isolation (“impivaaralaisuus”).

# ** Pathway to New Consciousness Finland 2050
# #+begin_quote
# In the “New Consciousness” scenario, a looming ecological crisis,
# “World War III” of numerous small hybrid warfare conflicts, and
# ubiquitous ICTs have led to a new kind of consciousness and worldview
# altogether. Values of deep ecology have become the norm.  People do
# not conceive themselves as separate, self-profit seeking individuals,
# but deeply intertwined with other humans and with nature. Phenomena
# are conceptualized and understood from a systems-oriented worldview,
# which sees “everything connected to everything else” – as parts of a
# single, global system. Society is organised as open global
# collaboration and sharing of resources and information.
# #+end_quote
# *** 2015
# People have become much more connected than before. Social media with its emphasis on sharing, communities and collaboration is becoming the norm in “real life” as well.
# *** 2017
# Finland is adapting to the “connectedness” development more slowly than many other countries. This is manifested in the use of media, which in Finland is still dominated by traditional media companies.
# *** 2020
# The Finnish economy is still dominated by manufacturing and industrial production, while most of the developed countries rely on services. Due to this lag in development, Finland continues falling behind its reference countries both culturally and economically.
# *** 2021
# The downfall of traditional Finnish industries has left an economic vacuum to be filled. A multitude of economic invaders—often from open source and collective urban movements—emerge to fill the void.
# *** 2025
# A new global contradiction is arising. Sharing, collaboration and altruism are seen as the path to progress. Unfortunately, in many countries inequalities between citizens are a serious blockade to a harmonious, collaborative society.
# *** 2030
# Finland is still a relatively equal country in terms of distribution of wealth and education. Finland decides to tap the potential and begins promoting politics and economics of good life.
# *** 2035
# Environmental problems cause conflicts around the globe. New global superpowers, especially China, are using global instability to spread their geopolitical stance. Cyberattacks and grassroots propaganda are used as well as traditional means of war.
# *** 2040
# The atmosphere of warfare is ubiquitous as “soft” means of warfare reach citizens’ minds. Enemies are using very clever ways of sowing paranoia and distrust among civilians.
# *** 2045
# Stable and equal Finland is seen as a safe-haven amidst global chaos. As early adopters of sharing technologies involving, e.g., brain-to-brain communication, Finns become forerunners of the “New Consciousness” practices and mindsets, paving the way out of the global turmoil.
# *** 2050
# Germs of the new, shared consciousness begin to sprout throughout the globe. The phenomenon of the anxiety-ridden self that tries to secure social status, pride, prestige and power starts to evaporate, and humans are finally finding a peace within themselves, each other, and nature.

# ** THE ISSUES CARDS

# A «Issue» card describes one of the common flaws encountered in the
# existing or planned Smart Cities.  Each card shortly documents the
# core of the issue and stakes related to this flaw.

# ** THE ACTIONS CARDS

# A «Action» card describes one of the interventions that could happen
# in the urban space. They can worsen as well as fix the issue. Each
# action leads to a reaction, so remember to find the right balance
# between positive and negative impacts.

# ** THE RULES CARDS

# A «Rule» card defines the setup of the game. You can either play with
# the basic rules or create your own.

# ** THE PLACES CARDS

# A «Place» card defines a location in the urban space that could be
# affected by the flaws of the Smart City. Some of these places are
# already part of programs connecting cities, whereas others appear to
# be grey areas, neglected in the effort in improving the urban
# infrastructure.

# ** ¶ RULES

# ** 📖 #1 GUARDIAN ANGEL

# You are the guardian angel of the Smart City. In each issue, you see a
# flaw that can be repaired.

# In this mode, you have to imagine how the action may solve the issue
# in relation with the specific place of the city you have chosen. Your
# solution has to generate positive externalities for the whole society.

# ** 📖 #2 EVIL GENIUS

# You are one of the most prolific evil geniuses in town. In each issue,
# you see a potential flaw that, if exploited, could unleash chaos in
# the streets.

# In this mode, you have to imagine how the action may aggravate the
# issue when linked with this particular place of the city. Your
# solution has to generate negative externalities for the entire
# community or for a specific population.

# ** 📖 #3 BLANK RULE

# ** 📖 #4 BLANK RULE

# ** ¶ ACTIONS

# ** ⚙ #1 GAMIFY

# Make it a game.  Set achievements.  Earn points and badges.  Impose
# the reign of fun.  A gamified solution can foster motivation and
# involvement as well as constraining citizens’ behavior by telling them
# what has to be done and what is considered a success.

# ** ⚙ #2 VISUALIZE

# As social and physical environments are getting more and more complex,
# they may lack legibility.  Making it visual succeeds when words fail
# to represent intricacies or to catch the attention of an audience.
# Visualizing reveals hegemonic processes and can highlight unexpected
# hidden interactions.  But is it good to make everything transparent?

# ** ⚙ #3 MAKE ACCESSIBLE

# While digital and physical touchpoints are becoming more diverse
# across our life and our experience of the city, the simple fact of
# ensuring access is a first step towards equity.  Then, there is the
# question of levels of access. Is it only about to be able to see
# something, to go somewhere or also to be able to have an impact on a
# situation?

# ** ⚙ #4 HUMANIZE

# Make it more human.  This could mean to add a sense of community,
# desires or sensitive feedback, but also an ounce of irrationality,
# unpredictable emotions and antisocial behavior.  It definitely could
# bring a new layer of unavoidable complexity.

# ** ⚙ #5 TRACK

# Using digital devices and connected objects leaves traces. They are
# persistent artifacts of both our digital and physical presences in the
# hybrid urban spaces.  These traces can be tracked and then
# recorded. Tracking and aggregating them may lead to anticipation and
# control.

# ** ⚙ #6 REDUCE

# Big buildings, big infrastructure and big ambitions. Things tend to
# grow, but the human scale remains unchanged. They are the symbol of
# our desire for an infinite expansion.  Is it worth to see things a bit
# smaller?

# ** ⚙ #7 CONTAIN

# New territories mean new identities, new identities mean new barriers
# and new borders. Containment has for long become a strategy to set
# points of reference, lines to not cross and elements to restrain.
# What or who will you contain?  For what purpose?

# ** ⚙ #8 TINKERING

# Nowadays, things are programmed to go straightforward, not meaning
# they head for the right direction.  You might help to set things right
# by hacking, tweaking, interfering and adding some glitches in the
# current processes. Start from the existing blocks and reconfigure them
# with your own adjustments.

# ** ⚙ #9 SLOW DOWN

# Everything is going faster.  This is not even a cliché anymore.
# Immediacy has become both a technological and a cultural expectation
# for connected things. What could be the outcomes if some processes
# were slowed down?

# ** ⚙ #10 CO-BRAND

# Good news, you are a brand.  Bad news, everything has become kind of a
# brand.  Marketing and brand content are pervasive and persuasive. As
# brands are joining forces in some unique ventures, what could be the
# next unexpected association in town?

# ** ⚙ #11 OVERSIMPLIFY

# Simplification is a necessity, but also a defense mechanism when
# having to handle a complex situation.  Oversimplification may be
# driven by a lack of time, attention or rigor.  Downside, it could lead
# to a wrong perception of reality.  But seriously, who likes to deal
# with complex situations?

# ** ⚙ #12 DISCONNECT

# Cut it off from the network, from people, from space or from time.
# Think disconnection as an act of resistance or as an unwanted and
# endured situation.  It is time to unplug things and people from the
# grid.

# ** ⚙ #13 ANIMALIZE

# Forget about civilization.  Unleash nature.  Release wildness.  Make
# it instinctive and primitive.  Bring the animal back in the game.

# ** ⚙ #14 WEAPONIZE

# Basically, it is all about turning something into a weapon, on purpose
# or not. Then, it grows into an instrument of power, reshaping
# established relations.  Just remember, a weapon serves two goals,
# defense and attack.  Which one would it be?

# ** ⚙ #15 BLANK ACTION

# ** ⚙ #16 BLANK ACTION

# ** ¶ PLACES

# ** 📍 #1 SHOPPING STREET

# Before malls, there were shopping streets. Welcome to open-air
# streetside stores, offering both local products and global brands.
# Competition is harsh, some stores will survive while some others
# disappear without leaving any trace.

# ** 📍 #2 PUBLIC PARK

# A green spot for recreational use and a conservation area for flora
# and fauna. Some of them even have nice playgrounds and highly
# allergenic pollen.

# ** 📍 #3 CONVENIENCE STORE

# For all the last-minute grocery shoppers out there.  Affordable
# products for everyday emergencies, longer opening hours, and a unique
# charm.

# ** 📍 #4 KIOSK

# The smallest unit for commercial or informational purposes in the
# urban environment.  Kiosks are also known to be hideouts for ill-used
# public touch screens.

# ** 📍 #5 MAIN SQUARE

# Usually, located not very far away from the town hall and getting
# really crowded on celebration days.  Also known as the best place in
# town for protests and demonstrations.

# ** 📍 #6 PUBLIC TOILET

# Not the most glamorous place in the city, but still one of the most
# badly needed.  Public toilets provide a large range of hygienic
# issues, from bad smells to drug use. However, they are also a place of
# curious rituals such as posting classified or personal ads.

# ** 📍 #7 SOCIAL HOUSING

# Affordable housing provided by State or non-profit organizations.  In
# the old days, it was a progressive solution supporting social equity.
# Today, it is likely to be viewed as a neglected piece of the urban
# infrastructure, only depicted as a synonym for social troubles.

# ** 📍 #8 CITY HALL

# Where decisions are made.  It hosts the representative governance of
# the city.  It can reflect both the embodiment of a personified power
# and the place where transparency, accountability and collaboration
# stand for actionable values.

# ** 📍 #9 PUBLIC LIBRARY

# A place where everyone can access knowledge for free and without
# having one’s personal data sold.  There are even rules to follow
# there, a bit old-fashioned if you ask.

# ** 📍 #10 PARKING LOT

# Cars are still part of the urban landscape, with or without drivers.
# So are parking lots, being set in plain sight or buried underground.
# And what about a parking for bikes?

# ** 📍 #11 TRAIN STATION

# The main urban transportation hub, but also a small-scale city.  It
# appears to be an inextricable mesh of accelerations and pauses, served
# by commercial services and supported by efforts to maintain a rational
# and efficient system.

# ** 📍 #12 MUSEUM

# Storing and showing artifacts which are not always coming from the
# past.  More than any other place in the city, museums are facing
# questions about the transformation of spaces into lines of code as
# well as the challenges of digitizing physical artifacts.

# ** 📍 #13 PLACE OF WORSHIP

# As it was one of the foundations of antic cities, the architecture of
# places of worship keeps being a constant crossover between
# functionalism and spirituality.  Temples, churches or mosques have
# been built as places for serenity, but age-old conflicts turned them
# into lightning rods for anger.

# ** 📍 #14 HIGHWAY

# Public ways, mostly roads, accessible for everyone.  These lanes are
# shared between an eclectic range of modes of transportation modes such
# as cars, drones, bikes, horses and even pedestrians.  Yesterday ruled
# by laws, tomorrow by computer code.

# ** ¶ ISSUES

** ⚡ #1 LOSS OF PRIVACY
:PROPERTIES:
:UNNUMBERED: t
:END:


By embedding sensors in the streets, the Smart City is under constant
surveillance; monitored by public forces and private interests.  Being
able to track and record activities has erased the notion of anonymity
promised by the urban structure and the crowd. Targeting marginality
with these tracking systems is allowing to get rid of, physically and
digitally, a specific population in a specific area.

** ⚡ #2 PROPRIETARY ECOSYSTEM
:PROPERTIES:
:UNNUMBERED: t
:END:


Smart City logic is oriented on a proprietary philosophy.  Using
closed standards, it carefully picks whom to deal with among a list of
designated institutional and business organisations or NGO.  This is a
locked environment led by market forces and strict partnerships, not
by a collective experience.  Don’t expect the permission to hack, to
tweak or to fork the smart systems.

** ⚡ #3 EMBEDDED VULNERABILITY
:PROPERTIES:
:UNNUMBERED: t
:END:

By integrating technologies into the urban fabric, it is bringing an
intrinsic fragility to infrastructure initially protected from this
vulnerability.  In addition to the inherent risks of cyber-attacks,
the absence of flexibility in the hardware and the lack of
interoperability between the digital standards are leading to fatal
errors.  In every meaning of the word.


# ** ⚡ #4 INFRASTRUCTURE FIRST

# Smart City programs envisage the city as a concrete structure only.
# Soft textures of the city, such as subculture or invisible public are
# conscientiously forgotten. A Smart City is focused on efficiency as a
# final goal, not as a means to develop common goods. But a city goes
# beyond a simple ensemble of commodities and for sure deserves more
# than the promises of security, convenience or efficiency.

# ** ⚡ #5 MISSING THE HUMAN SCALE

# Designing the city smarter often means observing people behaviors from
# a bird’s-eye view, without focusing on the everydayness and the
# individual. It is missing the messiness of humanity, which will
# inevitably jam the quest for a perfect logical urban system. City
# builders are still learning that dealing with humans is all about
# unpredictability, wildness, irrationality or digital illiteracy.

# ** ⚡ #6 CENTRALIZED POWER

# Smart Cities feature the rise of situation rooms and control centers.
# These closed places provide a topdown control of the infrastructure,
# seeing the city through a dashboard.  This centralized control and
# planning of urban facilities fail to stimulate incremental innovation
# by third parties. It can be considered governance by control rather
# than by community involvement.

# ** ⚡ #7 DECONTEXTUALIZED

# From catalogs to streets, Smart Cities offer generic technologies
# without really caring about their adaptation to a precise
# context. Technological propositions from the Smart City provide
# cultural codes which are not necessarily fitting together with local
# values.  If Smart Cities visions are rooted in a culture, it seems it
# is in a generic western lifestyle.

# ** ⚡ #8 GREENWASHED

# Greenwashing is an operational strategy in the Smart City sales pitch.
# With cities built from scratch and riddled with energy consuming
# devices, self-sustainability should be more than ever a primordial
# challenge.  The promises of smart grids don’t stand in front the
# increase use of rare earth elements and their nonecological extraction
# in faraway lands.

# ** ⚡ #9 ALGORITHMIC RELIGION

# Data-based decision culture takes roots into the over-reliance on
# digital technologies to solve social issues.  Algorithms may be
# reassuring, but also create distance between policy makers and
# citizens; since data don’t foster empathy.  Algorithms are not
# neutral, they embed ideologies and values from their creators. There
# is also a lack of transparency about which algorithms are used for
# decision-making.

# ** ⚡ #10 KEY TO THE CITY

# This is both a governance and a democracy issue. Who is in charge in
# the Smart City? Elected representatives, technocrats, algorithms, or
# private partners?  A Smart City is strongly dependent from its
# contractors and from outsourcing the updates of the urban tech
# infrastructure. It might lead to a lack of control in the
# liberalisation of and privatisation of public services.

# ** ⚡ #11 DATA BLIND SPOTS

# Data can’t see everything.  Even with a tight mesh of sensors, some
# urban activities are slipping away. Data also carry internal biases
# since they are a cultural construction, shaped by the choices made
# during the collecting and parsing processes of data. Looking for
# perfect knowledge is an unreachable goal, data providing only a biased
# and incomplete view of society.

# ** ⚡ #12 UNEMPOWERED CITIZENS

# Automation of the urban infrastructure is taking away responsibilities
# from citizens.  Constraining behaviors with new kinds of reward or
# rule systems envisages citizens as consumers only.  Smart City also
# fails at the necessary training of citizens to ethical stakes implied
# by tech in the city, preventing them from reclaiming control or
# assessing the smart infrastructure.  So, what about smart citizens?

# ** ⚡ #13 CODED OBSOLESCENCE

# Smart Cities are not so different from classical computers.  They are
# going to need vital updates for their software and hardware
# parts. Facing the challenge of getting old at the age of fast
# technological evolution, Smart Cities should start to stockpile spare
# parts to fix their future issues at the risk of becoming obsolete
# quicker than ever.

# ** ⚡ #14 AUTHORITARIAN SETUP

# The use of militarized technologies such as drones or sensors to make
# streets safer could also undermine resistance or protests against a
# local government. While security is becoming the main goal to fulfill,
# digital defensible spaces and crowd control strategies find an echo in
# the central management of city resources. Someone has already had his
# finger on the urban kill switch.

# ** ⚡ #15 BLANK ISSUE

# ** ⚡ #16 BLANK ISSUE

# ** ¶ THE BIG IDEA

# Flaws of the Smart City is a critical kit to explore the dark faces of
# the so-called Smart Cities.

# As any hardware or software piece, the connected cities embed flaws
# and this kit aims to fix these weak spots or to exploit them to set
# chaos.  The Flaws of the Smart City cards have been imagined in the
# first place for designers, urbanists, public servants and even small
# guys from big tech companies involved in the smart city business.

# The content of the kit has been built on the thoughts and works from
# Dan Hill (City of Sound), Adam Greenfield (Against the Smart City) and
# Anthony Townsend (Smart Cities, Big Data, Civic Hackers, and the Quest
# for a New Utopia).

# ** ¶ RULES OF ENGAGEMENT

# This is a workshop-tailored kit. It has been created to foster
# conversations during brainstorming sessions, to envisage provocative
# concepts and to build scenarios for debates.

# There are three main decks of cards:

# - Issues, listing current and emerging flaws of smart city projects.

# - Places, listing both common and forgotten urban spaces.

# - Actions, listing interventions that could influence places and issues.

# Here is an example of settings for a workshop using this kit:

# 1. Choose a city which will be used as a social, cultural, geographical and economical context for the exercise. It can be your hometown or a random location far away.

# 2. Select a game mode (see the cards of rules).

# 3. Assemble a card of each deck (Issue + Place + Action) and use them as a base for brainstorming. Imagine, speculate and define the new services or products related to the Flaws of the Smart City.  Add a flavour of fiction, embed ideas in everyday stories and tell how it will change urban environment as well as the society.

# 4. Variation: you may decide to split the discussion group according to two roles, one part focusing on causes and actions, the other focusing on reactions and consequences.

# 5. Document and share ideas or discussions triggered by this workshop.

# ** APPENDIX: Previous pilot: KAIJŪ INTRODUCTION TO PEERAGOGY

# Our workshop will introduce attendees to peeragogy: an interconnected
# collection of techniques for peer learning and peer production. The
# learning mind-set and strategies we are uncovering can be applied by
# students, teachers, groups of friends, communities of practice,
# hackerspaces, organizations, wikis, and/or networked collaborations
# across an entire society! In this workshop we put peeragogy into
# action as we break into small groups and play "Flaws of the Smart
# City", a futures studies game that imagines scenarios for the
# evolution of urban environments. After playing, each group will do a
# Project Action Review to reflect on lessons learned. Subsequently, the
# groups will present their PARs to the wider audience so everyone can
# learn from their experience and extract patterns. Finally, all
# attendees will "hive edit" a 500 to 1,000 word writeup of the workshop
# that will be included in the upcoming fourth edition of the Peeragogy
# Handbook.

# ** APPENDIX: WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION

# #+begin_quote
# The term kaijū translates literally as "strange beast". — Wikipedia
# #+end_quote

# Since we started working together in the Peeragogy Project in 2012, we
# have used many methods to pursue our shared goal of learning more
# about peer learning and peer production by practicing them together!
# We modified the US Army’s After Action Review (2002) to create the
# Project Action Review, as a way to cultivate shared mindfulness. We
# have fed our reflections into futurologist Sohail Inayatullah’s Causal
# Layered Analysis (1998) to create varied answers to the question ‘What
# is our vision for change and how is progress measurable?’. Along the
# way, we also experimented with patterns, poetry, and play. In this
# one-hour workshop we will demonstrate the power of these and other
# peeragogical methods with audience volunteers. To begin with, we make
# the ‘audience’ disappear and replace it with a ‘concerned public’!

# After a brief introduction to the methods mentioned above we will dive
# into playing a game called *FLAWS OF THE SMART CITY* developed by the
# Design Friction collective. We are now no longer watching a talk: we
# are residents of a city that has begun to take on a mind of its own,
# mediated by a Guardian Angel or an Evil Genius — or perhaps a giant
# lizard with psychic powers, if you so choose.

# We, as the concerned public, begin to relax into what we are doing
# enough to not be distracted by other things. We do not have any
# ulterior motives outside of the game. For example, when we are playing
# Flaws of the Smart City, we are not particularly worried about paying
# rent or publishing papers. We are not particularly worried about what
# our tablemates think about us: it is a fun game but it is not that
# serious. More or less we are embracing the phenomenon of being alive,
# here and now.  To bring these ideas home through another sensory
# channel, we suggest the song “[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y--5IlljO78][Shuffering and Shmiling]]” by Fela Kuti as
# a background soundtrack for the game-playing portion of the workshop.

# When we wrap up the game, each group will do a *PROJECT ACTION REVIEW*,
# addressing these questions:

# 1. Review the intention: what do we expect to learn or make together?
# 2. Establish what is happening: what and how are we learning?
# 3. What are some different perspectives on what’s happening?
# 4. What did we learn or change?
# 5. What else should we change going forward?

# We will then report back and take notes into a shared outline,
# following the *CAUSAL LAYERED ANALYSIS* template provided by Inayatullah
# (op. cit., p. 820):

# - The first level is the ‘litany’—quantitative trends, problems, often exaggerated, often used for political purposes—(overpopulation, eg) usually presented by the news media.

# - The second level is concerned with social causes, including economic, cultural, political and historical factors (rising birthrates, lack of family planning, eg).

# - The third deeper level is concerned with structure and the discourse/worldview that supports and legitimates it (population growth and civilizational perspectives of family; lack of women’s power; lack of social security; the population/consumption debate, eg.).

# - The fourth layer of analysis is at the level of metaphor or myth. These are the deep stories, the collective archetypes, the unconscious dimensions of the problem or the paradox (seeing population as non-statistical, as community, or seeing people as creative resources, e.g.).

# Lastly, we will co-edit this outline into a mixed media product —
# perhaps including narrative, poetry and images — reflecting on the
# process we have just experienced through the lens of a concept
# borrowed from religious studies (Batchelor, 2015): asking how does
# Peeragogy differ from other approaches? As regards the mixed medium
# presentation and experience as a whole, we take inspiration from the
# poet and visual artist Marcel Broodthaers (quoted by Wyma, 2016):

# #+begin_quote
# “I am now able to express myself on the edge of things, where the
# world of visual arts and the world of poetry might eventually, I
# wouldn’t say meet, but at the very frontier where they part.”
# #+end_quote

# Towards this end, we will strive to introduce the concept of a DESIGN
# PATTERN and exhibit them — in any reasonable format — in our writeup.

#  - A path as a solution to reach a goal (Kohls, 2010)

#  - Patterns are shared as complete methodic descriptions intended for
#    practical use by experts and non-experts (Leitner, 2015)

    :END:
Bicycles are a low impact means of transportation, particularly for
trips under 5km distance. They are an important, cost-effective means of
reducing traffic density and promoting healthy exercise. Community-based
cycling groups should be formed to promote cycling as a means of
transport. For instance, /Bike Marrickville/ is a volunteer-run group
of residents promoting cycling and improving the local environment.
Local groups can be affiliated with Bicycle New South Wales, the peak
body organisation for the promotion of cycling and cycling safety.

**** Pattern Conditions
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions
    :END:
*Enablers*

- The development of safe cycling infrastructures, marked lanes,
  separated pathways, adequate signage, laws that protect cyclists and
  their access to roadways. Digital platforms have made safe route
  planning far easier in Sydney.
  ([[http://www.sydneycycleways.net/map/]])

*Constraints*

- Cycling infrastructure and signage remains limited in Western Sydney
  in particular. Some areas are totally unsafe for cycling. The cultural
  climate and practices of motorists can make cycling unsafe.
- Lack of storage and shower facilities can limit the ability to use
  cycling as an alternative form of commute transport.
- Cycling may not be advisable during heat emergencies and also at times
  when bushfires bring smoke into cities.

**** Commoning Concerns
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns
    :END:
*Cycle Club* as social commons/transit

*Access:* Open to cyclists/commuters.

*Use:* Transportation and recreation, conviviality.

*Benefit:* Exercise, safety, reduced fossil fuel emissions, reduced
congestion.

*Care:* Community based organisations.

*Ownership:* Community residents.

Promoting access to cycling means challenging existing patterns of
development, transportation and infrastructure as well as cultural norms
around transportation and comfort at work. Cycling culture can be gender
and class exclusionary---its accessibility to women, low-income or
disabled populations would also require sustained advocacy and
facilitation from cycling advocates/organisations.

**** About this pattern
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-1
    :END:
For the first five years after a project delivery, the development
organisation and residents are responsible for existing public trees and
new ones, after which local government authorities take over caring for
them. Those first five years are vitally important if the trees, planted
and existing, are to be healthy and long-lived. During this time, the
community and development organisation can establish policies and
strategies for site trees, so that local government can continue with
the foundational tree management afterwards, including the on-going
appointment of a respected arboriculturalist.

Often people are afraid of big trees in public spaces or private gardens
because they may drop branches or fall on cars or houses in severe
storms. This can be addressed by *consistent arboriculture care* (for
instance visit the Arboriculture Australia website in resources
section). Trees can be encouraged to grow in particular shapes to remain
amenable to social commoning. There are various stages to caring for
trees so that branches do not fall, and trees remain healthy.

*First, trees need deep friable soil, air and water*. For trees in open
space, start with the Keyline method of preparing planting areas (see
the KEYLINE pattern). This will ensure healthy soil and water for good
growth. Tree planting in streets and public space need adequate areas
and depth of soil (see the pattern SELECTING SHADE TREES FOR PUBLIC OPEN
SPACE)

*Second, check and manage trees for insect pests* Providing the proper
cultural care in accordance with climate and needs of a tree species is
the best way to prevent insect infestations. Eucalyptus trees, for
instance, appreciate supplemental irrigation during prolonged dry spells
and experts at the University of California Integrated Pest Management
Program suggest watering eucalyptus plants once a month with a drip hose
until the top 12 inches of soil become moistened and performing
maintenance pruning when pests are waiting out the winter season, in
order to avoid attracting insects into freshly cut wood tissue (see
Kelsey [n.d.] in the references below).

*Third, prune and maintain branch and trunk health* to keep structural
soundness to withstand storms and strong winds. This can include
reducing the weight of the canopy by selectively pruning the ends of the
branches.

*Cable and brace* where branches need more support or have been damaged.
Cabling keeps tree branches from splitting at their junction. This
involves attaching various types of cables to stronger branches, the
trunk, the ground or other anchors. Cabling can also be used to support
unusually long limbs or reinforce weak-wooded species.

*Dynamic Cabling* (or */‘Cobra'/*) allows the limbs to sway, putting less
stress on trunk and branches. Thus, tree continues to produce *reaction
wood* (special cells) in response to wind or other stresses.  Dynamic
systems generally use synthetic ropes instead of cables, and they
usually wrap rubber around the branches being supported, rather than
relying on metal hardware that has been screwed into the tree.  *Cobra
system* is a dynamic tree support system specially designed to be
flexible and shock-absorbing with different benefits:

- Gentle to trees, self-adjusting to the diameter growth of tree,
  requires practically no tools, and incorporates a shock-absorbing
  unit;
- Avoids defective growth, the ‘karate effect', abrasion and
  constriction, wounding;
- Encourages trees to grow reaction wood.

Cobra system components include cobra rope, anti-friction hose,
expansion insert, shock absorbers (Arbor Culture Pty Ltd, n.d.)

*Crown thinning and lifting* allows more sunlight to pass and air to
flow through the canopy. This is done by removing some secondary
branches. Crown lifting raises the height of the crown and allows more
space underneath for lawns and gardens.

*Good Arboriculturalists can undertake these procedures and maintain
your trees with annual inspections.*

**** Pattern Conditions
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-1
    :END:
*Enablers:*

- Undergrounding powerlines means trees can grow full mature form.
  Streets can become signature avenues.
- Assisting local government to lobby for TAFE course on Arboriculture.
- Establishing a caring for trees community group is a positive step.
- Tree care gives opportunities for residents and children to learn to
  be ‘citizen scientists' by monitoring specific trees (see Australian
  Citizen Science Association in the resources section).

*Constraints:*

- On-going cooperation with local government during and beyond the
  five-year period.
- Protocols required to prevent storage or emerging structures within
  canopy drip-line.

**** Commoning Concerns
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-1
    :END:
Canopy Trees are one of the most effective ways to cool commons. ‘Cool
commons' are spaces and places offering cooler temperatures than
surrounding areas. Such commons are used by, and are accessible to, a
community of commoners who, to some degree, care for, take
responsibility for, and benefit from this coolness.

*Access:* Unrestricted access and involvement; restricted when
undergoing care

*Use:* Recreation, Biodiversity, wildlife corridors

*Benefit:* Environmental benefit, carbon capture, amenity of public
space

*Care:* Developer; Local Government; Body Corporate; community;
arboriculture consultancy.

*Responsibility:* Developer; Local Government; Body Corporate;
community.

*Ownership:* Body Corporate; community.

**** About this pattern
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-2
    :END:

*Cool Winds*

Site planning for coolth requires mapping prevailing winds; cool winds
in summer and cold winds in winter.

Using tree planting to direct cool winds and block cold winds, can
reate turbulence on both sides of solid barriers. This contrasts with
open canopy and open fencing, where the wind can pass through without
turbulence. Groves of trees, rather than rows, effectively channel
prevailing winds and achieve greatest density of canopy when species are
mixed.

*Canopy Density* is increased when trees are crowded; crown branching
changes with crowding, providing shorter primary branches and more than
twice the volume of other branches. The branching is flatter and crown
volume is bigger.

*Sun/Shade*

Site planning for coolth also requires a sun/shade analysis for 9.00am,
12.00pm, 4.00pm throughout winter & summer.

Winter sunlight is best achieved with deciduous trees. The quality of
shade depends on trees' attributes including leaf area; high branch
density; multiple canopy layers; canopy transmissivity; canopy size and
projection and canopy ventilation.

**** Pattern Conditions
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-2
    :END:
*Enablers:*

- Channelling summer winds to cool open space can reduce temperatures &
  humidity. Blocking winter winds facilitates warmth;
- Summer shade is increasingly essential, as is winter sun.

*Constraints:*

- Tree management to achieve healthy growth and arboriculture care to
  prevent falling branches is essential.

**** Commoning Concerns
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-2
    :END:
*Access:* open access for public open space; wheelchair access under
trees in groves is a dilemma, as it will inhibit soil and root health.

*Use:* recreation, wildlife corridors, shelter, carbon capture, $\mathrm{O}_{2}/\mathrm{CO}_{2}$.

*Benefit:* human comfort, environmental contribution.

*Care:* essential arboriculture, irrigation, fertilization.

*Responsibility:* Local Government, Corporate Body of Building owners,
communities.

*Ownership:* Corporate Body of Building owners.

# **** About this pattern
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-3
#     :END:
# The walking school bus concept originated in Japan, but was popularised
# initially in Australia. Programs now exist throughout the world that
# organise groups of students travelling together on foot to school or
# other destinations, under the supervision of staff and volunteers. The
# walking school bus is seen by policy makers and local authorities as a
# way to promote safe exercise and conviviality, and to reduce traffic
# choke points associated with the school commute.

# **** Pattern Conditions
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-3
#     :END:
# *Enablers*

# - There are many online resources that can be used to develop walking
#   school bus programs.
# - The efficacy of these programs can be greatly improved by the
#   development of policy guidelines that attend to both the safety and
#   walkability of local environments.
# - Brightly coloured jackets for the children are a good idea.

# *Constraints*

# - Walking school buses may not be advisable in areas where traffic
#   patterns and the built environment preclude safe pedestrian pathways.
# - Programs may not be advisable during heat emergencies or other adverse
#   weather events.

# **** Commoning Concerns
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-3
#     :END:
# *Walking school bus* as social commons

# *Ownership:* Participants (state and federal government).

# *Access:* Open to participating families that have organised a walking
# school bus program.

# *Use:* Safe and convivial walking transportation to and from school or
# other destinations.

# *Benefit:* Transportation, exercise, safe and convivial transport to and
# from school and reduced traffic congestion around school sites.

# *Care:* Distributed among parents and volunteers participating the
# walking school bus program.

# *Responsibility:* There are significant concerns around the question of
# responsibility: how to keep children safe during these activities and
# who bears this responsibility (in New South Wales this lies with
# participating parents and caregivers).

# **** About this pattern
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-4
#     :END:
# Trees that people love, create special places. Private trees have
# personal meanings to the people who planted them. They are often planted
# for their colour, flowers, & shape (see the pattern SELECTING SHADE
# TREES). Trees need care such as watering, pruning and checking for
# insect attacks (see the pattern CARING FOR TREES).

# Often people are afraid of big trees in private gardens because they may
# drop branches or fall on houses in severe storms. But trees are living
# beings so selecting the tree(s) for a garden will depend on how much
# space and deep soil is available. Site planning for private garden trees
# also requires mapping the prevailing winds so that garden trees and
# shrubs can channel cool breezes and screen winter winds. Also, where
# garden tree(s) are placed will depend on their purpose; that is, whether
# it is to shade the house and garden, provide privacy or to be a personal
# garden feature. It is a good idea to therefore map garden areas that are
# shaded in summer & are sunny in winter (see the pattern SITE PLANNING
# FOR COOLTH).

# *Using trees to make special places*

# Garden trees can create special spaces for children; the spreading fig
# for instance can make an outdoor room and is easy to climb. Pairs of
# columnar trees like small poplars can make a gateway to separate one
# garden space from another. A weeping garden tree, such as white cedar or
# Golden /Robinia/ can also create a shady nook for reading on a
# comfortable garden seat.

# **** Pattern Conditions
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-4
#     :END:
# *Enablers:*

# - Private trees personalise individual houses and are driven by people's
#   needs and aesthetic taste. Cooling shade and winter sun improve
#   comfort within private homes.

# *Constraints:*

# - Some Local Government Authorities have Tree Preservation Orders which
#   require permission to fell garden trees.
# - Current Urban Growth Release developments do not have enough garden
#   area or soil to support shade trees.

# **** Commoning Concerns
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-4
#     :END:
# *Access:* private and shared where trees overhang fencing or cross

# *Benefit:* Emotional well-being, climate amelioration, carbon capture,
# benefits for bird life, outdoor coolth that allows people to reduce
# their indoor use of air conditioning.

# *Care, Responsibility and Ownership:* Private owners.

# protocols such as those enacted in Poundbury to ascertain value
# alignment (but without the elitism [Beamish, 2017]), this process

# - The ‘trial live in' can be streamlined into the handover process when
#   potential buyers are looking to assess the benefits of living in the
#   area. No external policy framework needed to implement this.

# *Constraints*

# - Streamlining involves a lengthier hand-over process with greater

# **** About this pattern
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-6
#     :END:
# Accessible Water is a pattern that promotes the integration of water for
# play, drinking and cooling into the public domain, to enhance space
# cooling effects through evapotranspiration and personal cooling through
# contact with water. In low humidity, peak ambient temperatures can be
# reduced by three to eight degrees Celsius
# ([[http://www.lowcarbonlivingcrc.com.au/sites/all/files/publications_file_attachments/rp2024_guide_to_urban_cooling_strategies_2017_web.pdf][Guide
# to Urban Cooling Strategies]]).

# It might be in the form of splash pools or small rills and misting. It
# is an important /infrastructure of care/, enabling people to move
# comfortably out and about on hot days or nights and a way to enhance the
# quality of outdoor play spaces, particularly during summer. It requires
# thought about how people move through the city and where and when they
# seek to gather, as well as the nature of the space where the water is
# made available, so as not to create any harm to people. For example,
# water play spaces should meet the NSW
# [[https://everyonecanplay.nsw.gov.au/][Everyone Can Play]] guideline.

# Accessible Water is an addition to swimming pools and Water Sensitive
# Urban Design (WSUD) features that are important for retaining water in
# the environment. Measure of success for these public spaces include
# maintaining full accessibility and operational up-time, and also
# maximising attendance.

# In addition to WSUD features, making the most of access to existing
# natural assets is another important means by which neighbourhoods can
# benefit from coolth. In particular, still water bodies such as lakes,
# ponds and pools provide opportunities for people to relax and cool down
# by padding or swimming. Ideally public water bodies will be most easily
# accessible from the shallow end.*

# Still water provides opportunities for the community to relax around the
# water edge, for instance, stairs can provide seating for water places
# that have a slope. Seating also allows for natural surveillance, which
# aids safety.

# **** Pattern Conditions
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-6
#     :END:
# *Enablers:*

# - Strong community support for accessible water across different
#   delivery modes.
# - Cooling and liveability city plans (e.g. Penrith City Council, 2015;
#   Parramatta Ways Walking Strategy, 2017) and academic research (Mellick
#   Lopes et al 2016; Mellick Lopes et al 2019) signal accessible water as
#   a key consideration to enhance community cooling, participation in the
#   commons, and urban walkability.
# - Availability of a natural water area such as a lake, pond or river
#   that can be retrofitted for public use.
# - Artificial features such as ponds can be adapted for access if they
#   have shallow access points and slip resistant surfaces. Pond surrounds
#   can often be easily adapted for safe use.

# *Constraints:*

# - Drought conditions may limit water for play.
# •
#   Usability and toxicity of still water needs to be assessed and meet
#   safety guidelines.
# - Material and finishes selection must consider slip and trip hazards.
# - Risks of ultraviolet radiation and sunburns if shade is not available
#   will need to be actively managed by those responsible for the common.
# - Opening hours of most parks and water play areas currently limit
#   evening use.
# - The community may have varying degrees of comfort with delineating
#   human, animal or shared use of the common.
# - Still water quality must be suitable for public access. Some water
#   bodies become more polluted following rain. This should be signposted
#   to ensure safe access and use.

# **** Commoning Concerns
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-6
#     :END:
# Accessible water is a key infrastructure of care to support commoning.__

# *Access:* Designing for equitable access is an important consideration
# and should apply Universal Design Principles wherever possible.
# Decisions will need to be made around the shared access with animals.

# *Use:* When the common is typically enabled by the land or asset owner
# for improved amenity, its use would not need to be negotiated by the
# community. In some instances, in the case of still water reserves for
# instance, swimming, paddling, resting and socialising with friends and
# family might be negotiated with communities involved.

# *Benefit:* All residents, visitors, birds and animals benefit. Space can
# be provided for wildlife; a place for the community to paddle, swim and
# cool down.

# *Care:* Shared between asset owner (i.e. maintenance, repair) and
# commoning community (monitoring and some day to day care and maintenance
# related to still water resources). Local Bushcare groups can play a
# vital role in some bushland water bodies.

# *Responsibility:* While the asset owner would have a legal
# responsibility, the commoning community would be required accept the
# risks associated with the use of the potentially dangerous common.

# *Ownership:* Local government; National Parks and Wildlife Service. The
# systems which ensure the safe operation of the infrastructure, along
# with the asset itself is typically owned by a local council.

# A commoning concern will be tolerance for shared use, human and animal.

# Communities are complex and they experience the physical world in
# diverse ways. There are differences between the elderly, youth, children
# and different cultural groups in terms of the ways they use and enjoy
# public open spaces. Some parks in Japan have included sensory devices
# for both visually and physically impaired visitors that enables them to
# enjoy the coolth provided by still water (see the pattern ACCESSIBLE
# WATER).

# [[http://danishdesignreview.com/kbhnotes/2018/7/20/sansehaven-garden-of-the-senses][The
# Garden of Senses]] in Copenhagen is the largest public sensory garden in
# Denmark. It was designed by Landscape Architect Helle Nebelong who
# specialises in gardens and playgrounds for children with a disability.
# Here: “Plants are chosen for their distinct shapes and there are herbs
# for their smell or even their taste” while “the dense but low planting
# also shields the garden from the more noisy and boisterous park beyond
# to make the space feel somehow calm and protective” (Nebelong, n.d.).
# Her desire is for the people who use her garden /to touch, smell and
# listen if they cannot see,/ /to touch, smell and see, if they cannot
# hear and/or/ /to touch, smell, listen and look at anything within their
# reach if they cannot walk./

# Meanwhile, budding gardener programs give children the opportunity to

# Cooking facilities built into parks allow for wide access and use.
# Outdoor cooking reduces heat and moisture inside buildings during

# shelter to protect cookers from direct sunlight but need to be well
# ventilated.

# Outdoor cooking facilities attract gatherings of families and friends,
# encouraging shared cooling outdoors. They can be an important part of
# both day and night-time use of parks that are central to local
# festivities, sports events and social events such as children's birthday
# parties (Özgüner 2011).

# *Constraints*

# - Facilities need to cater to diverse cultural cooking practices
#   (Özgüner, 2011).
# - To attract night-time usage, facilities need to be appropriately lit.
# - Stoves and barbecues can be dangerous to the unskilled, such as

# **** About this pattern
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-9
#     :END:
# Protecting, maintaining and growing street trees requires a long-term
# commitment. With care, trees should be long-lived, healthy and provide
# increasing shade to enable cool streets. The attention to good growing
# conditions and on-going tree management that maintains shade-giving
# canopies suggests that installing and caring for street trees should be
# done in unison with urban water management. (See the patterns MANAGING
# ON-SITE WATER & CARING FOR TREES).

# *Growing conditions -- soils*

# The designated area for street trees is restricted requiring site and
# technical planning for adequate soil volume. Soil depth is important,
# but more essential is the soil area for roots to spread and access
# oxygen. Because of competing users in streets -- pedestrians, services,
# vehicles -- the maximum area for lateral root growth can be achieved
# through porous paving and grass from property boundaries to kerbs.

# In paved plazas, the use of Structural Soil Systems (SSS) composed of a
# two-part system of cellular modules for strength and structural support
# (load bearing) and filler soil can enable tree growth. In this way,
# structural stability is provided, plus interconnected voids for root
# penetration, air and water movement.

# *Growing conditions -- water*

# Water-sensitive urban design can ensure that water reaches the roots of
# the trees; this includes redirecting kerb water through spaced inlets
# into the tree pits.

# *Tree Selection*

# - Ten criteria are relevant to street trees in urban environments:
# - Drought & Heat tolerance are increasingly important in UHI. Isolated
#   trees can experience high heat and radiation loads in urban areas,
#   increasing tree water stress; plant trees in groups to mitigate this.
# - Wind tolerance is relevant as urban trees have to withstand
#   turbulence.
# - Tree longevity is reduced in urban environments.
# - Pollution tolerance: the effects of pollutants on trees can cause the
#   tree to weaken and die. Most pollutants to trees are airborne,
#   including oxidants, sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide; sunlight
#   reacts with oxidants to form tree pollutants such as ozone.
# - Pathogen and pest susceptibility and manageability
# - Potential as allergens to humans and animals: of the 50,000 different
#   kinds of trees, less than 100 have been shown to cause allergies; most
#   allergies are specific to one type of tree or to the male cultivar of
#   certain trees.
# - Shade cast (see the pattern SELECTING SHADE TREES)
# - Maintenance required; this is generally higher in a younger tree in
#   order to attain the form needed to suit site constraints.
# - Tree litter: all trees will shed litter, leaves, bark, flowers or
#   fruit at some time during a given growing season. Plane trees drop
#   hard fruit which can be a pedestrian hazard.

# *Size Matters*

# One strategically located large-stature tree more impact on conserving
# energy and mitigating the urban heat island effect than a corresponding
# quantity of smaller trees. Larger trees do more to:

# - Reduce stormwater run-off.
# - Improve local air, soil and water quality.
# - Reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide.
# - Provide wildlife habitat.
# - Enhance the attractiveness of an area.
# - Promote human health and well-being.

# The bigger the tree, the larger the benefits and, ultimately, the better
# the community's quality of life.

# *Siting*

# Shade trees in public open space can be situated beside paths, around
# gathering spaces and can provide shading for play equipment. The canopy
# shape determines most effective shading (see the pattern SELECTING SHADE
# TREES).

# */Street Tree Considerations **/*

# - A shade rating greater than moderate to heavy:
# - Requires high maintenance; requires formative pruning; has low litter
#   drop;
# - The minimum height clearance required under canopy is 4.6 metres on
#   roads and 2.5 metres on footpaths.

# **** About this pattern
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-10
#     :END:
# *Water Sensitive Urban Design* (WSUD) is a form of water management for
# on-site storm water and runoff. It involves capturing and storing
# stormwater, reducing water consumption and impact on local water
# systems, and improving water quality. This is achieved using grassed or
# landscaped swales, infiltration trenches and bio-retention systems,
# gross pollutant traps, wetlands, sediment ponds, rainwater tanks for
# storm water harvesting and as cooling devices, rain gardens, rooftop
# greening and urban forests, porous pavements, aquifer recharge and
# reuse.

# *Rain gardens and bioswales* are vegetated depressions located on
# gradients. Their main function is the retention and infiltration of
# stormwater. Acting as a filter for runoff from permeable surfaces, they
# reduce pollutants which enter storm systems. They are a way to manage
# bioretention areas by capturing and holding roof and road runoff but
# will not maintain optimal drainage rates if soils become compacted, it
# is therefore important to minimize foot traffic in this area, except
# walking for maintenance. Regular applications of mulch maximize the
# swale's ability to capture and break down contaminants. Rain garden
# plantings should not be fertilized to prevent excess nutrients run-off.

# *Structural soil*s are an engineered soil mix designed to allow three
# functions: reduce pavement heaving and breakage; improve stormwater
# infiltration; and improve tree growth. Structural soils can also
# improve stormwater infiltration if covered with a porous paving material
# (see Seattle Green Factor (2008 p.4) for more information). *Stormwater
# planters* are containers designed to capture and either retain or
# filtrate stormwater, based on their design. The amount and frequency of
# water captured depends on storm events, so they should be populated with
# a variety of plants adapted to both wet and dry conditions. Visually,
# they can be striking landscape features providing a high functional
# value.

# Properly designed soil conditions are required to achieve stormwater
# infiltration and increased plant growth. Deep soil is considered to be
# that which is penetrating to base rock and water table. In planters,
# soil depth should be a minimum of 600mm for shrubs and ground covers and
# minimum of one metre for small trees.

# *For improving water efficienc*y: rain sensors fitted to irrigation
# systems can reduce water use; amalgamated planter beds will improve
# efficiency of irrigation systems and mulch in garden beds reduces water
# evaporation from soils.

# *Permeable Paving*

# Permeable paving allows sites to infiltrate stormwater in a way similar
# to natural systems. Permeable pavements also restrict non-point source
# pollution from entering surface water bodies, which helps keep creeks
# and streams clean. Permeable pavements also contribute towards healthier
# plantings because root systems are aerated. *Permeable asphalt* can be
# used in some cases to replace traditional asphalt and allow for
# infiltration of stormwater.

# *Permeable concrete* can be used in place of impervious concrete in many
# non-driving situations. Its use in parking lots can help reduce the
# amount of stormwater runoff and non-point source pollution.

# Instead of pavers, the top layer can be either 150mm of Permeable
# Asphalt or 150mm of Permeable Concrete, layered over 150mm of Open
# Graded Aggregate, layered over Geotextile on the existing subgrade.

# *Irrigation*

# An integrated irrigation system must suit site the condition and the
# requirements of the landscape. Efficient irrigation systems include:
# rainwater storage tanks; appropriate species selection; soil depth and
# soil quality to help minimise watering requirements and use of recycled
# water. TANKLESS Underground Rainwater Storage is one means to collect
# quality surface rainwater.

# *Using Storm Water for Wetlands and Water Features*

# On-site storm water management can ideally finish in wetlands and water
# features.

# - Wetlands contribute important wildlife habitats and pleasant
#   recreation areas.
# - Water features can add interest to paved public spaces. Their wide
#   range of design styles and possible functional attributes can make
#   them useful elements for cooling and aesthetics. Water features can
#   also be engineered to clean & aerate water as well as recycle it.

# /Sustainable Sydney 2030/ targets include 10% of the City's water to
# come from recycled sources and a 50% reduction in the pollution being
# discharged into waterways. Within landscaped areas, Water Sensitive
# Urban Design (WSUD) provides the means to achieve these targets.

# **** About this pattern
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-11
#     :END:
# Heat stress can have a devastating impact on the animals cohabiting with
# us in our cities. This pattern identifies (and provides a basis for
# protocols for) infrastructures of care for cooling animals. These may be
# deliberately designed permanent structures, such as Fiona Foley's Lotus
# Line water sculpture at Redfern Park that invites multiple species;
# architectural features of built environments that incidentally gather
# water and/or provide shade; or more temporary solutions, such as bowls
# of water put out for animals to drink. The provision of habitat is
# another aspect of caring for animals in hot cities.

# The need for infrastructures of care for cohabiting animals in the urban
# common spaces is driven in part by human practices, such as water
# diversion for irrigation.

# Birds such as Ibises, which have migrated to cities because their
# wetland habitats are disappearing, are perceived as urban interlopers --
# alien and homeless. Cockatoos and Corellas have followed in their
# tracks. Providing cooling infrastructures of care thus challenges
# negative perceptions of animal-human urban cohabitation.

# **** Pattern Conditions
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-11
#     :END:
# *Enablers*

# - Creative thinking and engagement with communities to find solutions to
#   questions such as: What are people willing to share? Not bubblers says
#   Sydney Water -- therefore a need to move away from the bowl-like
#   design of drinking water fountains.
# - Delineating human only, animal only or shared use by design is an
#   important condition of this pattern.

# *Constraints*

# - Competing interests around ‘water efficiency'.
# - Policies limiting the access of animals to parks and other commons.

# **** Commoning Concerns
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-11
#     :END:
# *Access:* While there are distinctive policies limiting the access of
# companion animals to parks, public transport and other commons, the
# point would be for such infrastructures of care to be as freely
# accessible as possible.

# *Use:* Thirsty, hot, tired animals; temporary and intermittent use.

# *Benefit:* Animals, human carers, community of carers.

# *Care:* Local Government Authority with community monitoring the
# conditions of permanent structures. Temporary infrastructures could be
# housed with other commoning resources and cared for by the community.

# *Responsibility:* Local Government Authority and community of commoners
# monitoring heat conditions and responding appropriately.

# *Ownership:* Permanent water features owned by Local Government
# Authority; private buildings and private gardens owned by residents;
# commoning resources owned by community.

# Commoning concerns include knowing how to safely help and manage heat
# stressed animals; the impacts of large congregations of animals;
# cleaning infrastructures of care; collecting animal poo; smells; bee
# stings, bites and other injuries. Private residents may remove water to
# limit animal access or thriving mosquito populations.

# **** About this pattern
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-12
#     :END:
# Mobile play vans are free services offered by local councils. They are
# targeted at children ages six and under (the preschool population).
# They offer a regular schedule of safe and creative play and
# socialisation space, and a chance for families with pre-school aged
# children to meet and socialise, most often in local parks. These
# services will be important when parks or other amenities are not yet
# completed or have not yet matured. They are of great value in
# communities where residents with young children have limited capacity
# to travel to community centres or other facilities.

# **** Pattern Conditions
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-12
#     :END:
# *Enablers*

# - Council support is important.
# - High-quality shade is essential if playgrounds are to be accessible
#   during summer, while allowing for sunlight is important for
#   comfortable winter access. Adaptable shade cover, for instance,
#   deciduous trees and screens should be considered where appropriate.
# - Designing for accessibility ensures that all community members can
#   make use of a Play Van, including children with mobility restrictions,
#   visual impairments and so on.

# *Constraints*

# - Mobile play vans require safe open space that is situated away from
#   traffic but is also accessible for staff and participants.
# - Current mobile play van programs do not run in conditions of extreme
#   heat. They have also been suspended by some councils because of
#   Covid-19, pointing to children's health and public health risks in
#   general that have to be taken into consideration.
# - The success of these programs depends upon council's willingness to
#   fund outreach programs and to shoulder associated liabilities. These
#   sorts of interventions become less important as community and
#   community amenities mature.

# **** Commoning Concerns
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-12
#     :END:
# *Play vans* as public commons

# *Ownership:* Local Government; the community of users should also be
# encouraged to have a sense of ownership.

# *Access:* Children under age six and their family.

# *Use:* Active and passive play by children; socialisation opportunity
# for caregivers of young children.

# *Benefit:* Gives children access to space to play; inclusion of movable
# and adaptable resources encourages creative play; play outdoors has
# health benefits and lessens the use of air conditioning for indoor play.

# *Care:* Local Government generally has formal authority; local
# communities, however, play an important role in ongoing careful use.

# Programs like this should also make accommodations for the comfort of
# care-providers during play activities. If the goal is community
# belonging and cohesion, a chance for meaningful interaction among care
# providers of young children is of equal importance. Programs could be
# improved through incorporation of volunteer help, and with that comes
# the need to ensure child-safety through background checks.

# **** About this pattern
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-13
#     :END:
# Outdoor play areas provide resources and space for children and adults
# to play, rest and socialise. Playgrounds should provide less structured,
# natural materials and resources to stimulate the imagination and
# encourage creative play. Objects that can be moved and creatively
# adapted generate more engagement and creativity amongst users.
# Accessible playgrounds and those that include sensory features, such as
# plants that smell or feel interesting, ensure access for users of
# different ages and abilities. Playgrounds should provide several
# different areas for children and adults to group as well as to run and
# move.

# Outdoor play areas should be well shaded for access on warm days and
# allow for sunlight in winter. Unshaded artificial surfaces can get
# excessively hot during summer and should be avoided. In addition,
# adequate /infrastructures of care/ should be made available -- for
# instance water drinking fountains, seating to rest and accessible
# toilets. Outdoor play areas should be centrally located and there should
# be enough of them in a given area for locals to access easily on foot.

# **** Pattern Conditions
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-13
#     :END:
# *Enablers*

# - Planning for ongoing maintenance and management costs, including
#   maintaining play structures as well as seasonal garden management. In
#   New South Wales the government led initiative Everyone Can Play
#   ([[https://everyonecanplay.nsw.gov.au/]]) provides guidelines for
#   playground accessibility.
# - For adaptable shade cover allowing summer coolth and winter sunlight,
#   deciduous trees and screens should be considered where appropriate.
# - Designing for accessibility ensures that all community members can
#   make use of a playground space, including children and adults, people
#   with mobility restrictions, visual impairments and so on.
# - Designing for passive (e.g. sitting) and active (e.g. running,
#   climbing, bike riding) recreational activities makes playgrounds
#   useful for a broader range of users and in a range of heat conditions.

# *Constraints*

# - All playgrounds must meet Australian Standards
#   ([[https://www.kidsafensw.org/playground-safety/playground-standards/]])
# - Play areas that do not provide shade will have limited use on sunny
#   days; similarly, dense shade will limit use in cool seasons.

# **** Commoning Concerns
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-13
#     :END:
# *Ownership:* Local Government; the community of users.

# *Access:* For all people if designed for maximum accessibility. //

# *Use:* Active and passive play by children and adults. //

# *Benefit:* Gives children access to ‘natural' outdoor space to play;
# encourages creative play and collaboration among all age groups.//

# *Care:* Local Government generally has formal authority; local
# communities, however, play an important role in ongoing careful use and
# can also be responsible for or engaged in periodic maintenance (if they
# feel a sense of ownership).

# One commoning concern is providing shaded seating for carers, who may
# often be grandparents; another is encouraging a sense of ownership among
# locals and other users.

# **** About this pattern
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-14
#     :END:
# Every neighbourhood should include outdoor gathering spaces that
# residents can use for relaxing and socialising with others. These spaces
# can be co-located with outdoor play areas. Gathering spaces should be
# delineated from the broader environment through the use of structures
# such as seating, tables or shade structures that provide a sense of
# enclosure.

# Gathering areas should provide opportunities for large and small
# gatherings. Ideally, they will include a combination of both permanent
# seating and temporary seating that can be moved around to suit different
# needs. Food preparation areas including barbecues for outside cooking
# encourage use across the day and into the evening and they can be
# especially valuable on hot days. Outdoor gathering areas should be
# well-shaded for access on warm days and allow for sunlight in winter. In
# addition, adequate /infrastructures of care/ should be made available
# such as water drinking fountains, appropriate seating for different
# demographics and people with disabilities, and accessible toilets.

# - Usable open space that can be retrofitted (hence this is suited as a
#   remedial pattern) with seating and shade structures, ensures gathering
#   spaces that are usable across the day.
# - Trees and other shade structures that provide shade in summer and
#   allow sunlight to penetrate in winter can maximise the use of
#   gathering spaces across the seasons.
# - Consideration for maintenance of permanent structures and gardens and
#   care for temporary or moveable objects can bring greater involvement
#   and sense of ownership among local communities.

# *Constraints*

# - Unshaded areas will not be usable in hot weather. Shade density is
#   important in hot periods, therefore careful consideration must be
#   given to trees and other structures that provide sufficient shade.
# - While daytime use benefits from providing a sense of enclosure and
#   shade, dense foliage at night can be perceived as unsafe territory and
#   act as a deterrent if there are not more open outdoor gathering spaces
#   available in the evenings.

# cooking away from the home on hot days.

# *Care:* Local Government; engaged local communities.

# A commoning concern related to gathering outdoors will be the management
# of temporary fittings. This could be addressed by coming to arrangements

# **** About this pattern
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-15
#     :END:
# Quality shade is an important civic resource and is critical to human
# thermal comfort (Bloch, 2019). Shade is often, however, unevenly
# distributed across the city, with tree canopy roughly proportional to
# household wealth (Greater Sydney Commission, 2018). Shade structures are
# needed to provide immediate cool / protection from the sun in
# environments (such as linkages, nodes or even building interiors), where
# trees are absent or immature.

# While shade needs to be considered as an integral part of the planning
# phase, it is identified here as a remedial pattern as there are many
# existing hot environments, particularly away from coastal settlements,
# where the addition of shade could vastly improve comfort, accessibility
# and use.

# Shade can be fixed or dynamic, natural or artificial, hot or cool,
# permanent, temporary or worn. There are also many different qualities of
# shade: type, density, distance from ground and colour matter. Jacobs et
# al. (2018) at University of Technology Sydney for instance monitored
# climate adapted bus shelters and found a significant decrease in
# radiated heat from the ceiling of these structures, largely thanks to
# the insulated roof panels. Bick (2018), found blue shade sails provided
# the most effective shade in a study looking at the reduction of light
# intensity under different coloured shade sails. Shade from sails,
# however, was not found to be as effective as shade provided by awnings
# or natural tree canopy.

# Trees provide the coolest and most amenable shade, so preserving mature
# trees wherever possible is a critical first step. Trees provide critical
# cooling infrastructure in cities and removing them, even if they are
# replaced, represents a loss potentially of decades of shade, amenity and
# habitat. In Stuttgart, tree preservation orders protect city trees that
# have reached a certain circumference from removal.

# In areas of urban growth, however, shade needs to be factored back into
# environments from which trees have already been removed and ‘meanwhile
# shade' will be required.

# **** Pattern Conditions
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-15
#     :END:
# *Enablers:*

# - Strong community support for accessible shade.
# - Various cooling and liveability city plans (e.g. Penrith City Council,
#   2015; Parramatta Ways Walking Strategy, 2017) and academic research
#   (Mellick Lopes et al 2016; Mellick Lopes et al 2019) signal shade as a
#   key consideration to enhance community cooling and urban walkability.
# - Increasing urban heat due to climate change and rising incidents of
#   skin cancer in Australia are conditions informing the need for shade.
#   An ameliorating factor might be the increase of non-European migrants
#   whose skin types are more suited to the Australian sun.
# •
#   Trees can be slow growing; therefore, other shade measures need to be
#   sought.
# - Cancer Council Shade Guidelines and promotion of climate defensive
#   clothing including hats.
# - Guide to Conducting a Shade Audit.
# - Sun Smart policy has good traction in educational institutions.

# *Constraints:*

# - Limitations on planting new trees, shade structures and green façades
#   for climbing vines include: available space in the street scape; the
#   types of soil troughs required for planting; potential conflict with
#   underground or overground utilities, and wheelchair access.
# - Different trees provide different quality shade.
# - Not all shade is equal -- the shade provided by a city building in an
#   otherwise treeless environment, or by other people at a crowded,
#   uncovered bus stop, will not cool! The material covering the ground
#   and surrounds will influence the quality of the shade.
# - Some colours are hotter than others. There is a need for community
#   education around the thermal and reflective properties of colour.

# **** Commoning Concerns
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-15
#     :END:
# *Access:* depending on where shade is installed it might enhance access
# for public users, building users, animals seeking refuge from direct
# sun.

# *Use:* pedestrians, cyclists, building users, park users, animals.

# *Benefit:* all; the lifespans of some materials and finishes might also
# be improved with the protection of shade.

# *Care:* performed by local government for public spaces; building owner
# for private spaces; could be a community of commoners for living shade
# or temporary structures.

# *Responsibility:* all users; community might be tasked with keeping an
# eye out for problems with shade structures and informing local
# government or building owners.

# *Ownership:* local government or building owners.

# An important commoning concern is the ways in which shade can obscure
# visibility. For example, a covered park might inhibit the view of the
# night sky. Temporary shade to shield the sun during the day and open up
# to the sky at night could be explored.

#     :END:
# The vast spread of urbanisation results in alienated people and
# communities instead of a mosaic of recognisable suburbs that include
# many subcultures.

# Mosaics of subcultures need to be identified by boundaries, which are
# like ecotones that allow for social mingling with other subcultures as
# well as intensifying the subculture within the boundary. Such ecotonal
# areas can be shared playing fields, football and cricket ovals, public
# buildings such as libraries, large parks and water bodies. Where the
# boundaries are open space, they contribute to cooling of surrounding
# residential areas.

# A pattern for a great variety of subcultures in a city is not a pattern
# to form ghettos; rather it is a pattern of opportunity, allowing a city
# to contain a multitude of different ways of life with comfortable
# intensity. A rich mix of subcultures will not be possible if each
# subculture is being inhibited by pressure from its neighbours.

#     :END:
# Selecting shade trees need to be considered in accordance with the
# *broadscale context* and associated site dynamics related to the
# *detailed qualities of individual trees*.

# *Broadscale context*: trees grown in groves, rows and shelterbelts (see
# the pattern ESTABLISHING SITE FORESTS) have important microflora that
# connect all trees through fungal hyphae in the soil. Care must therefore
# be taken of root systems under canopy.

# *Details of individual tree species* include canopy types and tree
# shapes. Canopy shape determines the most effective shading.

# *Suitable Round-topped trees*

# - Evergreen (native)
# - Brush Box; Moreton Bay fig; Bunya pine (Araucaria Bidwillii);
#   Tallowwood (Euc microcorys); Plum pine (Podocarpus elatus).
# - Deciduous (exotic)
# - Plane tree; English oak.

# *Suitable Horizontal Canopy Trees*

# - Evergreen
# - River red gum (Euc camaldulensis); Spotted gum (Corymbia maculata);
#   Mugga Ironbark (Euc sideroxylon); Lacebark (Brachychiton discolor).
# - Deciduous
# - Golden rain tree (Kolreuteria paniculata); Jacaranda (Jacaranda
#   mimosifolia); Chinese Tallowwood (Sapium).

# *Suitable Pyramidal Tree*

# - Evergreen
# - River She-oak (Casuarina cunninghamiana); NZ Kauri (Agathis
#   Australis);
# - Silky oak (Grevillea robusta); Turpentine (Syncarpia glomulifera)
# - Deciduous
# - Golden cypress (Cupressus macrocarpa); Golden Lawson cypress
#   (Chamaecyparis Sp); Deodar Cedar (Cedrus deodara).

# *Suitable Open Canopy Tree*

# - Evergreen
# - Lemon-scented gum (Corymbia citriodora); Scribbly gum (Euc haemastoma;
#   Narrow-leafed ironbark (Euc crebra); Smooth-barked apple (Angophora
#   costata); Cotton tree Hibiscus (Hibiscus tiliaceus);
# - Narrow-leafed paperbark (Melaleuca linariifolia).

# The *quality of Shade* depends on trees' attributes including leaf area;
# high branching density; multiple canopy layers; canopy transmissivity;
# canopy size and projection; canopy ventilation.

# *Size Matters:* One strategically placed large tree has more impact on
# an urban heat island than same quantity of smaller trees. The bigger
# the tree the greater the benefits (see the pattern STREET TREES & PLAZA
# TREES).

# *Siting*

# Shade trees in public open space can be situated beside paths, around
# gathering spaces and can shade play equipment, as long as they have deep
# soil and have minimal intrusion into crown projection.

# *How much soil does a tree need? **

# Small trees ( under 7 metres in height) need 36m^{3} ; medium trees
# (between 7 --15 metres) need 38m^{3} ; large trees (above 15 metres)
# need 39m^{3}. Studies in the US and Canada indicated that most critical
# soil volumes fit into the 2 cubic feet/ per ft2 of crown projection,
# although the observation is general and not a hard and fast rule (see
# Grabosky, Bassuk & Trowbridge, 2002).

# *Dripline and Structural Root Zone* For stability, tree roots must be
# protected within the dripline of the canopy (the Tree Protection Zone or
# TPZ) as well in the Structural Root Zone (SRZ) around the base of the
# tree.

# **** Pattern Conditions
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-17
#     :END:
# *Enablers:*

# - _City of Sydney Urban Forest Strategy:_ The City has analysed the
#   amount of canopy cover required and set targets to increase the
#   average total canopy cover by 50% by 2030 and by 75% by 2050. This
#   will increase the canopy cover percentages from the current 15.5%
#   coverage to 23% by 2030 and 27% by 2050. Other Local Government
#   Authorities have Urban Forest Strategies.

# *Constraints:*

# - Trees selected for shade need the correct growing conditions including
#   preferred soil type, irrigation, fertilizer, monitoring for insect
#   pests and canopy management (see the pattern CARING FOR TREES).

# **** Commoning Concerns

# **** About this pattern
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-18
#     :END:
# Keyline Planning manages the existing landscape through enhancing soil
# quality, carbon capture and water holding capacity. Water naturally
# flows downhill running off ridges and concentrating in valleys. The
# basic site analysis for a keyline design includes identifying the ʻmain
# ridgeʼ (the watershed divide), ʻprimary ridgesʼ (convex slopes radiating
# off of the main ridge) and ʻprimary valleysʼ (concave basins receiving
# runoff between primary ridges). The ʻkeypointʼ is where the slope
# changes from convex to concave in shape and exists in valleys. It marks
# the highest point in the landscape to hold water.

# The contour passing through the keypoint is known as the ʻKeylineʼ.
# Subsoil ploughing along the keyline decompacts degraded soils, improving
# water infiltration, and distributing water more evenly. Subsoil plough
# regime helps restore a soil's structure and water holding capacity. The
# keyline subsoil rips create mini drainage channels diverting water
# gently downhill and back out onto the ridges.

# *This system uses the natural patterns of the landscape to catch and
# store water for use in cooling strategies.*

# **** Pattern Conditions
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-18
#     :END:
# *Enablers:*

# - Keyline Planning enables the rapid development of biologically active,
#   fertile soil within a systematically planned landscape. During an
#   average three-year conversion phase, four to six inches of new topsoil
#   are typically formed each year. This new topsoil stores large
#   quantities of water in the landscape.
# - Run-off water, stored in small dams, can later be released for rapid,
#   gravity-powered flood-irrigation.
# - Roads, forests, buildings and fencing that follow primary water layout
#   and fit together within the lay of the land.
# - Keyline Planning enables a permanent landscape where infrastructure
#   components help to passively ensure the maintenance and renewal of the
#   topsoil within it.

# *Constraints:*

# - Existing trees constrain where land modelling and contour ploughing
#   can take place.
# - Endangered Ecological Communities will constrain layout.

# **** Commoning Concerns
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-18
#     :END:
# *Access:* People are unrestrained; restriction for vehicles.

# *Use:* Open space recreation, channelling cool breezes.

# *Benefit:* Improve & maintain soil quality, water management and carbon
# storage.

# *Care:* Local Government and community of commoners.

# *Responsibility:* Body Corporate, Local Government and community of
# commoners.

# *Ownership:* Body Corporate, Local Government and building owners.

#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-19
#     :END:
# Bushcare groups have nearly forty years of history in Sydney and greater
# New South Wales. They use volunteer effort to engage in in a variety of
# activities that benefit the local environment including tree planting,
# bush regeneration, water quality monitoring, monitoring of wildlife
# populations and community education. They provide a means to guard
# against invasive species that can threaten biodiversity in the Bushland
# habitat. Bush care in this way resembles other volunteer-based
# organisations elsewhere in the world such as those in the US that
# preserve riparian environments (river keepers). In the US, the efforts
# of volunteer-based organisations have played a key role in conservation
# monitoring and their oversight has made national legislation like the
# Clean Water act so effective.

# **** Pattern Conditions
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-19
#     :END:
# *Enablers*

# - In Bushcare's long history, organisations such as the Australian
#   Association of Bush Regenerators have developed a number of accessible
#   resources that help local chapters to identify invasive species, and
#   to monitor and maintain local habitats more effectively.

# *Constraints*

# - Some invasive species may be so well established that their
#   eradication/management may prove to be impossible or their elimination
#   may have unintended consequences.

# *Ownership:* Voluntary organisation

# *Access:* Open membership

# *Use:* Ecological monitoring, ecological restoration, conviviality

# *Benefit:* Human and non-human communities

# *Care:* Voluntary organisation

# Bushcare has evolved as an inclusive practice of caring for country. As
# a consequence, it extends the terms of commoning and common-community to
# human and non-human species. The patterns of colonial settler society
# having wittingly and unwittingly introduced many species. While some
# have had devastating consequences for the local environment, others have
# become parts of varied human and non-human livelihoods; for example, the
# role of wild-invasive goats in rural livelihoods and in the management
# of other invasive plant species through their grazing habits. The
# management of plant and animals nowadays as part of country is an
# ongoing process of negotiation.

# **** About this pattern
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-20
#     :END:
# A key to producing place-based coolth will be a community of commoners
# who are prepared to initiate action and maintain the social and physical
# infrastructure that supports this action. Such a group will need a mode
# of organization and governance that is suited to this task. This could
# take the form of a registered non-profit organisation/ governing body,
# set up by elected representatives from within the residential community.
# In general, this body is voluntary, it enjoys autonomy and it does not
# have statutory powers over ownership, tenancy and so on.

# This form of community governance will enable the concerns of the
# residential neighbourhood or community/ housing complex to be addressed.
# These concerns can include:

# 1. Management, maintenance and upkeep of common areas and facilities,
#    including other cool commons.
# 2. Communication about cool places and cool/shaded times for different
#    locations in the local area throughout the year.
# 3. Individual initiatives such as recycling, composting, community
#    gardens, pedestrian infrastructure, shared playgrounds, upgrading of
#    parks, signage and so on.
# 4. Orientation and spreading awareness of neighbourhood concerns within
#    the membership, and connecting the neighbourhood to local governance
#    mechanisms.
# 5. Arranging regular meetings, gatherings, cultural events, fundraising
#    and so on.
# 6. Connecting with other community organizations concerned with local
#    amenity, for instance Bushcare groups, service associations,
#    churches, mosques or temples.

# More broadly, community governance can be integrated with strategic
# activities like a social enterprise lab where ideas are pitched for new
# ways to sustainably enhance commoning and to put new ideas into the
# public domain, or activities to promote the membership of other
# community-led groups -- The Seniors Hub in Waverton NSW for instance
# provides a good hybrid model for interests groups, it assists with aging
# in place run and is by volunteers but supported by the local council
# (see references and resources).

# **** Pattern Conditions
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-20
#     :END:
# *Enablers*

# - Community members who are already active, are usually a place to start
#   with putting community governance in place.
# - Community building techniques such as Asset Based Community
#   Development have stood the test of time as a means by which
#   communities can identify success and build on their strengths; these
#   kind of practices can be useful for healthy and productive community
#   governance processes.

# *Constraints*

# - Ongoing process of engagement require sustained interest and
#   leadership from within the local community.
# - Getting participation from a broad range of diverse residents.
# - Handover process and succession patterns have to be clearly identified
#   and set up.

# **** Commoning Concerns
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-20
#     :END:
# *Community governance* as a mechanism for commoning practice

# *Ownership:* non-profit or public ownership

# *Access:* Free access to all meetings and programmes, but
# decision-making power may rest with elected representatives

# *Use:* Community benefit decisions and activities

# *Responsibility:*

# *Benefit:* provide ongoing, adaptive solutions to community living

# *Care:* Residents' community

# Community governance organisations needs to involve constant efforts to
# strengthen practices and inclusiveness. This is because governance is a
# lived (and not static) phenomena. If governance is not strengthening, it
# is likely that it will be weakening.

# **** About this pattern
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-21
#     :END:
# Post-occupancy studies are protocols for evaluating the technical
# performance of (called post-occupancy analysis) and/or social
# satisfaction with (called post-occupancy evaluation) single or
# multi-residential buildings /after/ residents have moved in. This
# pattern seeks to extend current post-occupancy studies to emphasise the
# importance of learning from the experiences and practices of a community
# of residents. Such ongoing learning is critically important if the aim
# is to create liveable and sustainable places, as it could validate
# goals, help identify and address emerging issues and opportunities, and
# feed back into planning processes as a form of ‘continuous improvement'
# and lifecycle planning.

# Post-occupancy learning requires community engagement and outputs that
# can form a durable record of a living place to inform learning over
# time. This approach foregrounds and validates community expertise in the
# lived context, which is under-represented in the literature about
# liveability. Community stakeholders may initiate engagement around a
# particular common concern, on a one-off or regular basis. Concerns might
# be explored via regular resident walking meetings, workshops or social
# ‘living labs'. Mechanisms to ‘carry over' learning to improve the
# planning and development process needs to be created, with precedents
# existing in the form of collaborative governance arrangements (see
# Report). Post-occupancy learning could facilitate enhanced openness and
# trust and enable community-led innovation in planning and development
# processes. It could also prime communities to explore the transition to
# new practices, for example energy sharing, or new forms of water or
# waste management. Citizen science projects recording local weather and
# aspects of environmental change are a form of post-occupancy learning.
# Retaining collected data in a local library (in addition to handing it
# over to the investigating body [e.g. Australian Museum or Bureau of
# Meteorology]) would enable future generations of residents to access
# this data and facilitate intergenerational place-based learning. Adopt a
# tree programs, where residents ‘adopt' a young local tree planted by
# council and take responsibility for monitoring its health as it grows,
# is another example. In this case, succession planning is important,
# including mechanisms for intergenerational communication.

# **** Pattern Conditions
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-21
#     :END:
# *Enablers:*

# - Commitments to stakeholder engagement (e.g. Landcom's ‘Join-in
#   Charter').
# - Engagement Evaluation and Stakeholder Risk Framework.
# - Resident surveys (e.g. Healthy and Inclusive Places Survey) currently
#   captures ‘satisfaction' but not learning.
# - Leveraging interest in citizen science for fine grain environmental
#   monitoring.

# *Constraints:*

# - Scope limitations due to time constraints.
# - Limitation of access to and facility with digital tools.
# - Existing approaches to community engagement oriented to: project
#   delivery; forward planning/ ‘visioning'; short-term and front-end
#   engagement events. Conversely, post-occupancy learning is about lived
#   experience.
# - Access to tools to measure and capture information, experiences and
#   practices will need to be managed.
# - Legitimate pathways to loop post-occupancy learning back into project
#   planning, will need to be developed.

# **** Commoning Concerns
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-21
#     :END:
# *Access:* Residents and relevant stakeholders. The inclusion of newly
# arrived residents will need to be facilitated.
# •
# /Use:/ Residents, future-residents, community liaison officer and other
# development agency stakeholders.

# *Benefit:* Community and development agency processes; potentially
# external partners.

# *Care:* Community-led studies might require agreements to monitor on an
# ongoing basis; knowledge commons could be housed in community library.

# *Responsibility:* Development agency liaison, community of residents,
# library workers.

# *Ownership:* Knowledge commons produced by engagement processes -- who
# owns this, who has access and where is it housed, will need to be
# decided.

# Context information and site history -- who has access and where is this
# housed?

# Examples:

# - a study monitoring bird and insect life in the residential development
# - a study capturing and recording surface heat measures
# - a workshop to capture commoning concerns (could be a social living
#   lab)

# What and how experiences and practices are captured, and where and how
# outputs are stored, are key commoning concerns.

# Some members of the community may find the process ‘nosy'. This would
# need to be sensitively addressed.

# A key commoning concern will be accessibility to tools to measure and
# capture information, experiences and practices.

# **** About this pattern
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-22
#     :END:
# Shuttle buses offer free or low-cost transportation between main
# destinations (for instance between transit hubs and university or
# corporate campuses or to specific venues such as museums, shopping
# centres or swimming pools). They complement and address shortfalls in
# other forms of mass transit such as trains or buses that cover greater
# distances along specific routes.

# Shuttle bus services of this sort can be provided directly by the
# municipality. The Santa Barbara electric shuttle bus, for instance, runs
# from the edge of the city district to the downtown areas and to numerous
# destinations along the waterfront. The electric bus service is an
# important component of the Innovative Clean Transit Standards being
# adopted by the California Air Resources Board (Sustainable Bus n.d.). In
# Parramatta, The Shuttle is a free transport solution run by Transport
# for NSW through the Transdev mobility company, running seven days a
# week, that connects tourists, residents and commuters to commercial,
# retail and recreational landmarks. Alternatively, shuttle buses can be
# wholly or partially subsidized by the benefiting institution (for
# instance shuttles that cater to university students and staff).

# **** Pattern Conditions
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-22
#     :END:
# *Enablers*

# - Rapid transit by shuttle bus is enabled by bus lanes. The use of a
#   shuttle bus is enabled by infrastructure that ties it into other
#   transit infrastructure such as rail, light rail or ferries, in
#   particular designated stop points that incorporate shade and/or
#   shelter.
# - Municipal policies for clean air and reduced congestion can encourage
#   the formulation of shuttle bus services and local business that
#   benefits from reduced congestion and better customer footfall might
#   also be enrolled as sponsors.
# - Websites or mobile phone applications are a good way to enhance the
#   use and awareness of a shuttle bus service.

# *Constraints*

# - Buses require significant outlays of capital to purchase and maintain.
#   This can make a free service hard to sustain, especially when hitting
#   other targets, such as net zero emissions, necessitates upgrades. The
#   Santa Barbara electric shuttle was free, but nowadays riders pay 50
#   cents per ride, or buy a day pass for one dollar (Santa Barbara Car
#   Free n.d.); the service is cheap but not entirely free, signifying
#   tension in the enactment of a commons.
# - Given the expense providers may also operate only during the hours
#   that benefit a sponsoring organisation (such as Universities) and they
#   may not cater to the needs of a whole population.

# **** Commoning Concerns
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-22
#     :END:
# *Destination shuttle* as social commons/transit.

# *Ownership:* Various (municipality, university or another sponsoring
# organisation).

# *Access:* Open to commuters (particularly those bound for particular
# destination)

# *Use:* Commuters using the service.

# *Benefit:* Reduced fossil fuel emissions, reduced congestion, socially
# inclusive transport.

# *Care:* Municipality, University, Body Corporate, other.

# Destination shuttles work effectively in connection with other forms of
# mass transportation. They solve the last kilometre problem in getting to
# and from major destination such as universities, shopping centres and
# conference centres, and benefit a larger public by reducing congestion.
# A major concern is that they tend to be site specific forms of transit
# that do not directly benefit the public at large. This can lead to
# ongoing negotiations over who maintains/pay for these services and how
# much the public can be expected to support a transit form that only
# benefits a subset of the population.

# **** About this pattern
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-23
#     :END:
# ‘Cool commons' are spaces and places that offer cooler temperatures than
# surrounding areas. This pattern is concerned with how patchworks of
# places/spaces can provide more accessibility.

# Patchwork for accessible coolth is a pattern of scattered spaces, forms
# or services accessible to pedestrians; it is low-rise and integrated
# within neighbourhoods, enabling a /spectrum/ of fine differentiation.
# This pattern suggests an alternative to continuous blocks of
# development, or enclosed shopping centres.

# Examples of built form and space types that could be patchworked
# include:

# - Patchwork green in a city
# - Patchwork of social corners
# - Cooling refuges
# - Aged care
# - Pocket parks
# - Water play
# - Shops

# The accessibility of these places/spaces relates to the way people move
# through them comfortably and how they know where they are going.
# Patchwork analyses look at the fine grain, working closely with the
# diverse ways people use urban space. Three ways of considering
# patchworks (permeability & legibility; movement and responsive
# environments) are offered here.

# *Accessibility equals permeability & legibility*

# */Permeability/* is both physical and visual in the way it allows people
# to pass through; it entails both private and public interfaces and
# provides variety in the choice of movement. */Legibility/* exists where
# the places/spaces have understandable forms such as edges, nodes, paths,
# districts and landmarks (see Lynch 1960).

# *Movement through patchwork* involves a kind of serial vision, whereby
# elements of an environment -- buildings, trees, nature, water -- can be
# interwoven in such a way that causes anticipation to occur (see
# Cullen 1961)*.* We experience places in sequence, as the existing view
# and the emerging view simultaneously. Examples of these spaces are;

# - Enclaves, enclosure;
# - Focal points, precincts; /hereness/ and /thereness/;
# - Silhouette, incident;
# - Undulation, fluctuation;
# - Recession, anticipation, mystery.

# *Responsive Environments* provide users with a democratic setting,
# enriched by the degree of choice available (see Bentley et al 1985).
# Criteria for evaluating responsive places include:

# - Permeability: where people can go;
# - Variety: the range of uses a place can have;
# - Legibility: how people understand the place;
# - Robustness: how people can use a place for different purposes;
# - Visual appropriateness: the visual codes;
# - Richness or the choice of sensory experiences;
# - Personalization: people put their own stamp on places.

# **** About this pattern
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-24
#     :END:
# It is possible to manipulate the shape of a site to create sheltered
# cool pockets and areas for respite or pathways.

# Cool slopes are commons that provide coolth for people walking or
# running through a community or seeking respite around the community.
# They would typically have the greatest benefit either side of midday.
# Open space that slopes to creeks or lakes is ideal for the insertion of
# cool features such as cool banks, shade trees, grass mounds and paths*.*

# To create these cool commons, site planning should map the
# pre-development landform and slopes to take advantage of existing
# contours; sun (e.g. southern sides), wind and rainfall patterns; soil
# types and drainage.

# This requires a fine grain analysis of site contours, so that the
# existing site gets regraded to create these pockets of coolth where
# practical. The resultant mounding can be used to contain services such
# as underground rainwater storage tanks.

# Successful application of this pattern will yield complete shade for
# when the pocket is most commonly used.

# **** Pattern Conditions
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-24
#     :END:
# *Enablers:*

# - Local Environment Plans developed by local government require areas of
#   open space for common recreational use.
# - Integrating cool slopes, mounds or pockets within the ground modelling
#   can add to the amenity. Innovative approaches can be explored in
#   community workshops to enable civic participation in the design of
#   cool slopes.

# *Constraints:*

# - Open space has to allow for multiple recreation uses. Open space
#   planning often allocates flat land, so playing fields become the
#   dominant use. This precludes ground remodelling in an open space
#   context.
# - Mounding will have to be created with consideration of ecological and
#   hydrological impacts.

# **** Commoning Concerns
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-24
#     :END:
# *Access:* High consideration of accessibility for all abilities should
# be considered when applying cool slopes, and wherever possible the
# principles of Universal Design applied.

# *Use:* Passive recreation, integration into play spaces, urban design
# features, active transport pathways.

# *Benefit:* Increased amenity in public open space and improved
# walkability due to increased shade and cooler spaces.

# *Care:* Minimal care would be required by the community as the
# landowners would likely maintain this common as part of the broader open
# space maintenance.//

# *Responsibility:* The landowner would have ultimate responsibility, but
# the community would be required to use the common in a responsible
# manner.

# *Ownership:* Local government, development agency.

# Staging of construction activities at strategic locations may be
# required to sustain access to cool commons through the development
# process and beyond.

#     :END:
# Innovative cropping and consolidating measures to mitigate the impacts
# of loss of agricultural land and its associated natural systems on
# account of sprawling urbanisation, that results in the heating of urban
# space. This is exacerbated by the growing impact of motor transportation
# and related infrastructure on global warming. The appropriate pattern
# relates to topography, soils and hydrology where urban development is
# located on higher land and where agricultural land is located on the
# lower slopes and floodplains beside creeks and rivers.

# To achieve urban & rural fingers, there are several issues to address.

# *Equity Issues* necessitate innovative planning that allows owners to
# realise their land's development value without changing the rural use.
# This can be achieved through transfer of development rights (TDR).

# *New Farming Practice*: Maintaining rural and peri-urban fingers
# requires making productive land attractive to new farmers. The market
# growth of water products, ecosystem services, and niche marketing of
# gourmet products are emerging opportunities for rural economics inspired
# by new poly-cropping techniques.

# *New Forms of Rural Living*: European planners offer alternative models
# for ‘Rural Living' that allow for continued productive farming to be
# associated with new clustered residential areas. This involves
# innovative land tenure and inventive forms of governance that are drawn
# from organizational strategies associated with cooperatives.

# *New Urban Agriculture:* New urban agriculture associated with hybrid
# urban formulas that conflate architecture, landscape, infrastructure and
# high-tech farming, can instigate innovative forms of agriculture at the
# urban rural nexus.

# **** About this pattern
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-26
#     :END:
# Misting devices can be highly effective in cooling outdoor spaces. Dry
# misting has been used extensively in public open space in Keyaki, Japan
# and now in Toronto, Canada. Misting installations can also provide
# attractive, interesting features into public spaces including
# renovations of public parks, helping to increase their use. In some
# instances, municipal authorities can commission misting devices and
# misting fans as permanent or temporary art installations, which help to
# generate higher footfall for local restaurants and retail businesses
# (Roe, n.d.)

# Although seemingly a misnomer, ‘dry mist' is formed when water is pushed
# through a fine aperture at high pressure; the mist is so fine it
# evaporates, feeling dry, and lowers the temperature by up to 30°F.
# Misting fans are energy and water efficient, readily available and
# easily installed. Depending on the types and placement of plants,
# misting systems can double as watering systems, keeping plants lush and
# green.

# *Misting Pumps*

# The most expensive part of the system is the high-pressure pump because
# fine water droplets required for quick evaporation cannot be achieved by
# low water pressure. Solar panels can supply the energy needed.

# When installed and used properly, mist cooling systems can reduce
# temperatures by as much as 30°F depending on the efficiency of the
# misting system, relative humidity, and outdoor temperature. Evaporative
# cooling is remarkably energy andwaterefficient.

# *Misting devices cannot use stored on-site wate*r. The misting nozzle
# requires mains water in order to ensure there is no particulate matter
# to block it. There are also public health considerations if stored tank
# or run-off water is used for misting.

# **** Pattern Conditions
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-26
#     :END:
# *Enablers:*

# - Misting devices are relatively inexpensive and can be deployed
#   temporarily in public spaces, allowing seasonal use and reassignment
#   to other spaces.//

# *Constraints:*

# - Governance is required when used in public open space. There are some
#   health implications.
# - May not be effective in areas of high humidity.

# **** About this pattern
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-27
#     :END:
# Parks and other public spaces can be important cool commons in the
# evenings, when the heat of the day starts to dissipate from the public
# domain and when it becomes cooler outside than in the home. Well-known
# examples of night-time commons include night markets, festivals and
# outdoor film screenings, all of which tend to be concentrated in urban
# centres. As our summers get longer and hotter, the principle of the
# night-time commons needs to be adopted more widely in an overall
# strategy of rethinking how we use our local environments.

# This pattern explores night-time commoning as a cooling strategy. An
# important infrastructure that can be activated as night-time commons are
# public parks and swimming pools. These environments are already cool
# commons, but they tend to close in the evenings, precisely at the time
# when they could best serve the community by providing a venue for
# socialising, swimming, dining or other community gatherings on a hot
# night.

# Place-appropriate and engaging lighting is an important element in an
# overall cultural shift toward night-time commoning. It is an attractor
# for alternative park uses, to create ambience and promote safe
# wayfinding and play. An example is the /Gates of Light/ art
# installation at Macarthur Heights, a park designed for stargazing. In
# addition to lighting, the activation of night-time commons are most
# successful when they provide signage, other communications and
# activation events to legitimise use and raise awareness amongst the
# local community of the opportunities to use these spaces at night. This
# is important as unlike in Australia's regional neighbours, night-time
# commoning is unusual in Australia. This is where examples such as night
# markets, dance and exercise, or community cookouts, can provide
# inspiration for activating parks at night.

# Kevin Lynch's urban design principles cited in Dufner et al.'s (nd)
# night lighting study, focus on how people move through and experience
# the city.

# Measures of success for night-time commons are minimised incidents
# relating to safety, minimised disruption to neighbours and maximised
# attendance.

# **** Pattern Conditions
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-27
#     :END:
# *Enablers*

# - Increasing urban heat and the dangers of UV radiation (the Cancer
#   Council for example recommends staying out of the sun between 11am and
#   3pm) create a need to explore the use of outdoor public spaces at
#   cooler times of the day.
# - Night lighting, as well as provision of public drinking water and
#   public amenities, are important supportive infrastructures.

# *Constraints*

# - A challenge for night-time commoning might be that features of the day
#   park, such as permanent shelter and shade fixtures, could create
#   safety and visibility issues, and inhibit some night-time uses, such
#   as star gazing.
# - The impact of noise on surrounding residential neighbourhoods may also
#   need to be addressed.

# **** Commoning Concerns
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-27
#     :END:
# *Access:* The space used for this common is accessible in the same way
# that it would be during the daytime and by the same people.

# *Use:* Technical management could be entrusted by local government to a
# community of commoners if the use is different to the typical daytime
# use.

# *Benefit:* The night-time commons provides cool spots in open space to
# those people who have free time during the evenings.

# *Care:* The site is maintained per the standard daytime program,
# however, the commoning community and any contractors (i.e. cinema, food
# trucks etc.) must manage additional wear and tear to the common.

# *Responsibility:* The common is governed by the asset or landowner and
# the commoning community would need to regulate their own behaviour and
# safety.

# *Ownership:* The ownership does not change from the daytime structure.

# A commoning concern related to the socially-activated night time space
# could be managing noise for surrounding residents not using the park
# (for example shift workers). If use involves cooking, this could also
# mean issues with smells. This might be ameliorated by designing
# dedicated events for quieter usage or determining times for noisier
# events like dancing, markets or films by a community scheduling tool or
# poll. Night-time commons need to be designed co-operatively with the
# communities who will use them in order to address these commoning
# concerns.

# **** About this pattern
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-28
#     :END:
# Signage of all kinds, physical and digital provides an important
# orienting and way finding role in public life, thus supporting ways of
# commoning. Signage can be a temporary measure to provide an induction
# into the careful and appropriate use of a place, or to tell stories in
# order to enrich the experience of a place. Signs can also work in the
# other way as forms of punitive resistance to commoning, such as
# declaring private zones in an otherwise open /continuous environment,
# amplifying risks and dangers, or rendering place-based social practices
# illegal, such as congregating, fishing, walking, picnicking, climbing,
# camping and bird feeding.

# **** Pattern Conditions
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-28
#     :END:
# *Enablers*

# - City of Sydney regulations make mixed provisions that can support
#   commoning for a short-term period. “While commercial bill posters are
#   illegal, signage posted by community members to advertise garage
#   sales, find missing pets or to promote local fetes are not in breach
#   of these laws.” However, there is a one-week limit.

# *Constraints*

# - State Environmental Planning Policy regulates signage and provides
#   time-limited consents.
# - Risk management protocols favour signs that amplify risks and deter
#   use.
# - Signage can be visually unappealing and can seem to stand in for poor
#   design.
# - Signage can be easy to ignore.
# - Physical signage can disrupt airflow and be a hazard in high wind.

# **** Commoning Concerns
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-28
#     :END:
# *Access:* Those who can see and understand the sign.

# *Use:* Resident community, visitors.

# *Benefit:* Resident community, visitors, potentially animals and
# habitats, distributions of material resources .

# *Care:* Depending on the nature of the sign, care could fall to Local
# Government Authority, resident community or both.

# *Responsibility:* All users, Local Government Authority.

# *Ownership:* Depending on the nature of the sign, owners could be Local
# Government Authority, resident community or both.

# A commoning concern is digital accessibility to support online signage
# through digital maps, apps and wayfinding tools.

# The language and tone of voice with which a sign speaks can have an
# impact on accessibility. Signage is a limited measure that needs to be
# supported by social evidence -- for example people using a space
# quietly will be more influential than a sign saying ‘quiet zone';
# equally a ‘no swimming' sign will be overridden by people swimming in a
# water fountain. This raises a question regarding signs: not what agency
# does the sign have, but rather /when/ does a sign have agency?

# tree planting takes place below the Keyline contour. On primary ridges,
# cultivated strips/bands lie parallel and above the Keyline. Trees can
# also border roads above irrigation channels. Trees should be planted in
# Riparian corridors and planted surrounding water bodies.

# ***/Preparation and planting/*

# A specialised Keyline plough should cultivate strips/bands 4 centimetres
# below root depth, to aerate soil along contours. Trees should be planted
# as tube stock to ensure successful and rapid growth. Biodegradable tree
# guards and stakes are needed to facilitate moisture condensation and
# protection against grazing.

# ****/Establishing Forests through Ecological Succession/*

# Successional ecologies can be applied to forest management regimes in
# urban environments: rather than humans being the primary maintenance
# mechanism, we can start to use passive maintenance through environmental
# manipulation and an understanding of succession; for example,
# short-lived, fast-growing Acacia spp. species have been interplanted
# with various eucalyptus species, to encourage a faster growth rate and
# more upright form.***

# **** Pattern Conditions
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-30
#     :END:
# *Enablers:*

# - Existing trees may be part of remnant indigenous forests that can be
#   integrated with new forests.
# - Existing trees may be components of cultural heritage landscapes,
#   which should be kept & interpreted.
# - Successional planting can also be undertaken by communities.

# *Constraints:*

# - Rehabilitation of existing forests.
# - Arboriculture assessments of existing trees.
# - Conformity to Commonwealth EPBC Act (1999) & NSW Biodiversity
#   Conservation Act (2016)
# - Space to establish forests in urban areas is constrained by hard
#   infrastructure and conventions of planting single trees in

# **** About this pattern
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-31
#     :END:
# Pedestrian areas should be designed and created to maximise the use of
# outdoor space and encourage active transport (walking, running, cycling)
# around the local area. A network of active transport links to local
# amenities including parks, shops and public transport should be designed
# for safe shared use (i.e. concurrent walking and cycling). The fastest
# and most accessible walking and cycling routes should be signposted so
# that they are easy to find and navigate. There also needs to be a method
# for people to report observed problems. Trees that provide dense shade
# should be planted along pedestrian links so that it is comfortable for
# people of diverse abilities to travel locally on foot or by other means.
# Temporary shade structures should be used to provide shade while trees
# grow. Accessible “infrastructures of care” including shelter, seating,
# access to municipal drinking water and universal toilets are essential
# to support pedestrians.

# **** Pattern Conditions
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-31
#     :END:
# *Enablers:*

# - Ensure that new developments do not break up transport links. Consider
#   how public streets and transport links will be maintained over time,
#   including maintaining shared footpaths, signage and shade cover.
# - Clean signage indicating best and safest routes to key locations will
#   encourage use and provide contact details and an invitation to people
#   to care for the shared amenity by reporting problems.

# *Constraints:*

# - Limited amenities to support comfortable and safe mobility such as
#   shade, drinking water and places to rest will limit use of public
#   streets. Personal safety concerns may limit use.

# **** Commoning Concerns
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-31
#     :END:
# Public street as commons

# *Access:* Access for all, including people, personal mobility vehicles
# (bicycles, strollers), animals (particularly dogs).

# *Use:* For transiting the local neighbourhood, including between houses
# and to nodes such as transport and local shops.

# *Benefit:* Encourage active transport and discourage car use in the
# local area; provide open space and shade for users.

# *Care:* Local government will have formal responsibility; engaged local
# communities will use transit spaces carefully and take part in reporting
# issues and ongoing maintenance as required.

# *Ownership:* Local government, except in the case of private roads.

# Commoning concerns include the ways that users interact and negotiate
# use of shared transport zones (for instance in shared cycling and
# walking zones, pedestrian crossings and other places where active
# transport and car users intersect). Traffic calming devices and clearly
# signposted crossings make local streets safer and ensure that cars give
# way to pedestrians.

# The provision of shade can inhibit visibility, leading to perceptions
# that a place may be unsafe. Encouraging collective walking will address
# personal safety concerns, particularly at night.

#     :END:
# A heat preparedness plan is part of a commons-infrastructure that
# enables community response to heat emergencies and helps to keep
# vulnerable people safe at these times.

# The Heat Preparedness Welcome Pack should include a heat emergency
# preparedness guide that explains the available infrastructure showing
# how to respond to heat events in this community. The pack should
# identify cooling infrastructures and resources, and the chain of command
# for activating a heat emergency and protocols for checking in with
# neighbours. The ultimate aim of such a pack would be the creation of a
# community-based governing body of stake holders that maintain this
# commons-infrastructure.

# **** About this pattern
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-33
#     :END:
# Temporary or ‘meanwhile' use of outdoor public unused space or private
# space earmarked for future development, can provide opportunities for
# site activation which reduces urban heat island effect, through greening
# activities or through providing public access to private cool spaces.
# Examples include pop-up uses such as shops or markets that use cool
# materials or urban gardens. Existing car parks or vacant lots can
# provide a platform for improved local cooling, with interventions
# reducing the amount of impermeable low albedo hardscape.

# *Citizens as urban co-producers*

# Precedents for occupying urban spaces with temporary projects include
# the Paris-based Atelier d'Architecture Autogeree. Their “ECOboxes”
# (pictured) are installed in different neighbourhoods as temporary
# platforms for participatory gardening and a mix of other social and
# cultural activities. Activities include workshops, talks, screenings,
# preparing and sharing meals. Another example is R-Urban, which is a
# network of closed local ecologies where participants only consume what
# is produced. Temporary urban gardening can encourage local capacity
# building and encourage new forms of collaborative governance. For
# example, in Brisbane, a community negotiated the right to develop a yam
# plantation (pictured) on unused land for a three-year period, agreeing
# to cover all costs including relevant insurances. The whole community
# was involved in the preparation, cultivation and harvesting of the crop
# which was then distributed among the community and to charity groups.
# When the land was needed by the governing institution, a new plantation
# was created temporarily elsewhere (Armstrong, 2016, p. 72).

# The measure of success for this pattern includes reducing the ambient
# and surface temperature of unused land by increasing the quantum of
# permeable or shaded surfaces; the longevity of the access negotiated to
# maximise the temporary use, and the social and community return on
# investment generated during the term.

# This pattern does not include temporary use of buildings as Cooling
# Refuges (see separate pattern).

# **** Pattern Conditions
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-33
#     :END:
# *Enablers:*

# - Landowners wanting to maintain asset values during the construction
#   phase of staged precincts through activation and placemaking, with the
#   ability to provide temporary use development applications (or similar)
#   to facilitate meanwhile uses for a term period.
# - Community liaison officers and community representatives can actively
#   encourage citizens in their neighbourhood to initiate new activities,
#   and function as brokers for temporary use.

# *Constraints:*

# - Temporary use implies collaborative governance arrangements, which may
#   need to be negotiated if not already in place and can take time.
# - Protocols for temporary use will need to be worked out by the partners
#   involved, to establish procedures and divisions of responsibility.
#   These protocols, like the spaces themselves, will need to be adaptable
#   and open to renegotiation as circumstances change. A temporary use
#   handbook, provided as part of a “welcome orientation”, would support
#   residents to understand protocols.
# - Temporary use equipment and resources will need to be stored and
#   managed. This might involve negotiating arrangements with local
#   businesses, the local library or community centre.
# - Political and logistical challenges may emerge, should a community
#   desire to transition from temporary to permanent use.

# **** Commoning Concerns
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-33
#     :END:
# *Access:* Unrestricted access. The inclusion of newly arrived residents
# will need to be facilitated, and the space should maximise opportunity
# for Universal Design principles.

# *Use:*The commoning community would negotiate any uses that facilitate
# the reduction in surface and ambient temperature, while improving public
# access to sites that are not being utilised or are currently
# inaccessible.//

# *Benefit:* Community capacity building; convivial sociality directed
# into potentially positive new social practices.

# *Care:* Community groups, body corporates, or other governance
# mechanisms utilised. For this common, the landowner would likely not
# provide any maintenance.

# *Responsibility:* Community groups, body corporate, site visitors or
# contractors engaged by the commoning community.

# *Ownership:* Developers or local government.

# For some members of a community, for example shift workers, noise might

# **** About this pattern
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-34
#     :END:
# Car shares are ways of sharing access to automobiles for a variety of
# uses. They can be organised informally or among community members, but
# the contemporary car shares make use of web-based platform technology to
# grant access to vehicles that are either privately owned or owned by a
# ride-share service such as Go-get. The City of Sydney, like cities
# elsewhere, has allocated a portion of available street parking to car
# share programs in order to ensure equitable access. Car share programs
# can work to reduce car congestion, carbon emissions, and demand for
# parking spaces by offering an alternative to private automobile
# ownership.

# **** Pattern Conditions
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-34
#     :END:
# *Enablers*

# - Municipal approaches to management of parking resources can help
#   facilitate use of ride sharing programs.
# - Platform based technologies provide a way of coordinating ride shares,
#   as well as assurance and regulatory oversight.
# - Car sharing schemes work well in the city of Sydney where parking
#   space is a limited resource, where there are several transportation
#   alternatives and where school, work, shopping and other amenities are
#   nearby.

# *Constraints*

# - Ride sharing can be cost prohibitive. Like other platform-based
#   enterprises, the model can be wealth extractive and counter-productive
#   to a commons.
# - Long distances between home, work, school and shopping may discourage
#   use of ride sharing services.

# **** Commoning Concerns
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-34
#     :END:
# *Carshare* as social commons/transit

# *Access:* Open to licenced drivers enrolled in ride sharing programs.

# *Use:* Local transport; use in longer distance transit on trips where
# cargo also needs to be carried.

# *Benefit:* Reduced fossil fuel emissions, reduced congestion.

# *Care:* Ride share coordinating body.

# *Ownership:* Various forms of ownership of different
# infrastructures/devices are involves (public or private ownership of
# cars, platform technologies, and parking space).

# Car sharing provides a way of replacing private ownership of automobiles
# with shared use. While city dwellers benefit from an improved
# atmospheric commons, and reduced demand upon public infrastructure,
# questions remain around both the taxation and regulation of
# platform-based enterprises.

# **** About this pattern
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-35
#     :END:
# *Annual fêtes or fairs* can be fund-raising activities for any community
# that help to foster stronger community identity and pride in
# achievements.

# *Street parties and fêtes* are ways to get to know neighbours and build
# strong communities. They can be important ways to celebrate together.
# Most Councils support neighbourhood gatherings as they foster community
# spirit and good neighbour relations. A successful street party could be
# as small and intimate as a few chairs in a front yard, up to a BBQ in
# the local park, or a party in a local street.

# *Temporary Structures*

# If a tent, marquee or stall is erected, it requires local government
# approval either as a public building under the /Health Act/ or as a
# temporary building under Building Regulations. Local government may
# waive this requirement for low risk structures. As a general rule if the
# public are within or on the facility it should have local government
# approval.

# Temporary structures such as merchandise stalls, seating, food stalls
# and so on must be erected and secured in accordance with the
# manufacturers specifications to ensure they are structurally sound and
# can withstand likely wind in the locality.

# */Sustainability Considerations/*

# Some Councils have sustainability strategies and rules whereby events
# need to reduce the use of plastic packaging and plastic cutlery and
# crockery for the service of food, and to encourage recycling by stall
# operators and patrons. The City of Sydney has a no balloons policy in
# all of its parks and open spaces. Balloons are not be permitted for any
# events.

# */General Considerations/*

# - For residents/neighbours only; should be self-organised;
# - No licence normally necessary if music is incidental and no alcohol is
#   sold;
# - Closure of residential roads only; apply for road closure at least 6
#   weeks before the event.
# - Public liability insurance optional but advisable/sensible; organisers
#   must accept responsibility for possible claims if public liability
#   insurance is not in place.
# - If not formal risk assessment is in place, protocols for managing
#   health or other emergencies are planned in advance.
# - Considerations for night parties include ensuring appropriate
#   visibility and notifying neighbours.

# Event Clear Up; provide suitable waste receptacles and make arrangements
# for litter picking and waste removal after the event.

# **** Pattern Conditions
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-35
#     :END:
# *Enablers:*

# - Local Governments support street parties in principle because they
#   enhance social cohesion and contribute to a greater sense of trust and
#   safety, and better health and well-being in the community.

# *Constraints:*

# - Mobile Food Facilities (MFF): For safety purposes, operators of MFFs
#   are required to secure a health permit prior to operating. MFFs are
#   usually restricted to */Pushcart/Ice Cream Cart/* distributing
#   pre-packaged non-potentially hazardous foods only; no food preparation
#   is permitted; For a */Hot Dog Cart/* limited food preparation is
#   permissible but no complex food preparation; For a */Food Truck/* full
#   service and food preparation is allowed within the enclosed vehicle.
#   No food preparation is allowed outside the food truck (except for an
#   outdoor barbeque).
# - Risk assessments should consider: Slipping, tripping or falling
#   hazards (e.g. loose carpets, unsecured cables); any vehicles driving
#   onto site; electrical safety (e.g. use of any portable electrical
#   appliances); poor lighting, heating or ventilation; storing and
#   serving food (e.g. chilled items being left out of the fridge for too
#   long); and any other hazards you may find.
# - A fire risk assessment is a *legal requirement* -- the person
#   responsible for the event must make a suitable and sufficient
#   assessment of the risks.
# - Noise Control at Small Outdoor Events: _Inform all affected people of
#   the following_

# 1. The event (offer free tickets or invite people along);
# 2. Start and finish times;
# 3. The Complaint Hotline number if they want to make a complaint.

# **** Commoning Concerns
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-35
#     :END:
# Common spaces can be used for temporary events, particularly if they
# offer cooler temperatures than surrounding areas and if they are used
# by, and are accessible to, a community of commoners who, to some degree,
# care for, take responsibility for, and benefit from this coolness.

# *Access:* Varies; outdoor markets have access for all; parties and
# fund-raisers by invitation.

# *Use:* Recreation, fund-raising.

# *Benefit:* Community engagement, strengthening the use of common space.

# *Care:* Event organisers and community.

# *Responsibility:* Event organisers and community.

# *Ownership:* Body Corporate, community.

# A commoning concern will be negotiating road use: ensuring adequate
# notice of road closure and legible signage to alert drivers. Another is
# ensuring dogs are leashed to ensure safety.

# **** About this pattern
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-36
#     :END:
# Community libraries can integrate multiple uses and forms of knowledge
# at various scales and provide readily accessible interior and exterior
# cool spaces. Community libraries provide free access to books,
# audiovisual, and other materials to local residents who must be members;
# some extend into lending household and other items as well such as
# tools, toys, and cooking implements.

# Libraries usually provide free internet access, although this may be
# time-limited, and many provide charging ports for electronic devices.
# Libraries can combine or balance indoor and outdoor spaces and include
# bookable meeting and discussion rooms. Most libraries are used for
# learning and other events such as classes or reading groups, whether
# organised and run by library staff or other non-profit organisations.
# Many libraries include cafes.

# Libraries can provide free community cooling refuges during times of
# extreme heat, provide early childhood and local health services, and
# house a knowledge commons of and for the community.

# **** Pattern Conditions
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-36
#     :END:
# *Enablers*

# - Community buildings such as libraries can serve an important function
#   as cool refuges in times of extreme heat (Bradford et. al. 2015).

# *Constraints*

# - Libraries require funds for construction and there is an imputed or
#   actual cost of site allocation (if purpose built).
# - The maintenance and management of libraries cost and effort; this
#   requires trained and qualified professional staff.

# **** Commoning Concerns
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-36
#     :END:
# Community libraries are a public commons.

# *Ownership:* Community libraries are usually in public ownership and
# most often owned by Local government. State and Federal levels of
# government also provide large institutional libraries.

# *Access:* Access is free and open to anyone. Joining the library bestows
# rights such as borrowing and internet access.

# *Use:* Libraries can be used for education, recreation, and life
# management through internet access to online government services. They
# also provide spaces for spontaneous interaction and, where the
# infrastructure is conducive, spaces for interaction, meetings and
# learning activities outside.

# *Benefit:* Libraries provide immense benefit including learning, social
# interaction, life management, community engagement and cool spaces.

# *Care:* As public assets, libraries are cared for by paid staff who are
# government employees, although users are also asked to respect the space
# and the rights of other users.

#     :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-37
#     :END:
# Many development sites have remnant indigenous vegetation. It is
# important to understand whether this vegetation is part of an Endangered
# Ecological Community. In the Sydney region there are twelve
# designated*endangered ecological forests*listed under
# the*Commonwealth Government's Environment Protection and Biodiversity
# Conservation Act 1999*(EPBC Act), of which six are critically
# endangered. NSW Government also has a new*Biodiversity Conservation Act
# 2016*(BC Act). In the BC Act, threatened ecological communities are
# defined by the NSW Threatened Species Scientific Committee. The BC Act
# lists over 100 threatened ecological communities. All except four are
# primarily made up of plant species.

# A threatened ecological community is listed as either a “Vulnerable
# Ecological Community”, “Endangered Ecological Community (EEC)” or
# “Critically Endangered Ecological Community (CEEC)”. Maps of the
# Communities are available
# at[[http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publiclookupcommunities.pl]]

# *Site Planning Stages*

# Existing forests and woodlands on a site need to be mapped and tree
# species identified. If it is a remnant stand of one of the EEC/CEEC,
# then protective ribbons need to encircle it. The extent of the
# particular EEC/CEEC can be verified through the NSW Dept of
# Environment. An arboriculture assessment of tree health is then
# required.

# *Excavation, Hydrology, Drainage*

# The hydrology of the area adjoining the trees, particularly upslope,
# will need to be mapped. It is important that no earth works or changes
# to site drainage occur within the vicinity of the trees.*Mature
# Eucalypts & Angophoras are particularly susceptible to altered
# drainage*.

# *Endangered Ecological Forests in the Sydney Region*

# - Blue Gum High Forest of the Sydney Basin Bioregion (CEEC)
# - Castlereagh Scribbly Gum and Agnes Banks Woodlands of the Sydney Basin
#   Bioregion (CEEC)
# - Coastal Upland Swamps in the Sydney Basin Bioregion (EEC)

# **** About this pattern
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-38
#     :END:
# To control heat and humidity in a large park we need to map the paths of
# cooling breezes as well as the areas where there are no breezes, and
# then map the topography and porosity of the soil to determine where
# water is most likely to collect (usually in the lowest lying areas).

# This process will locate the most and least pleasant microclimates. We
# can then discern where to locate devices to provide shade and clean air,
# dehumidifiers to reduce moisture, fountains to lower ambient
# temperatures and even ultrasonic speaker systems to drive away
# mosquitos. These will make up a pattern of devices for the benefit and
# comfort of the users of the park. They will reinforce areas that are
# already made comfortable by reducing the heat and humidity through means
# such as specific plants and trees chosen for their ability to shade
# according to their canopy, or water fountains and atomisers to cool the
# air.

# According to the number of devices in a given area, the spaces are more
# or less enjoyable, more or less comfortable. Such climatic devices can
# be versions of park furniture such as benches, fountains, or sculptures.
# Their role will be either as dehumidifiers, or as devices that cool
# surfaces from underground pipes or that decrease the intensity of light
# or create shade. In planning for the park, buildings can be located in
# the most uncomfortable areas whereas recreational and leisure activities
# can be situated in the most comfortable microclimates; that is, where
# heat and the relative humidity level will be at a minimum. The lowest
# lying parts of the park are likely to collect rainwater, and so generate
# higher air humidity. This is where the dehumidifying devices should be
# placed. Keeping in mind the relationship of the park to its topography
# and the water that is collected, *keyline* sub-ploughing can be used to
# slow down rainwater and enable it to infiltrate as closely as possible
# the places where it falls into the superficial layers of soil.

# Multi-use community centres are spaces that are open to residents for a
# variety of uses that can range from informal through to formal and
# structured. These activities are usually free or provided on a
# non-profit basis. The centre should be intimate but flexible enough to
# suggest and enable a range of uses such as celebrations, meetings, and
# classes.

# Multi-use community centres should include a kitchen and toilets, be
# accessible to people with diverse abilities, and be safe and inclusive
# spaces. Flatt access routes and shaded areas for seating outside provide
# inclusivity and coolth.

# They can also include a range of indoor and outdoor spaces; teenagers
# and young adults are often overlooked in planning, so they may need more
# consideration as specific target users. Repurposed sales offices could
# be used as multi-use community centres.

# **** Pattern Conditions
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-39
#     :END:
# *Enablers*

# - Public funds to support the management and/or the construction of

# - Community support, fundraising and co-production related to
#   construction and/or the management of facilities.

# *Constraints*

# - Current development patterns and processes do not readily generate
#   sites or funds for the construction or management of multi-use
#   community centres
# - Current sales and occupancy processes do not generate a ready pool of
#   potential community-based site managers

# **** Commoning Concerns
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-39
#     :END:
# *Multi-use community centres* are a hybrid commons that mix ownership
# and management of assets between institutions in different sectors and
# which can combine non-profit principles with the principles of
# enterprise.

# *Access:* Free for residents and should be easy and universally
# inclusive; events, activities, and classes may have a fee

# *Use:* As per their name, multi-use community centres enable a range of
# activities and provide spaces and opportunities for spontaneous
# interaction.

# *Benefit:* Multi-use community centres provide a social focal point that
# enhances the identity of the community and possibly provide cool
# interior and exterior spaces.

# *Care:* When a non-profit organisation is the occupant, they are usually
# responsible for care and maintenance. Casual users (e.g., for a birthday
# party or meeting) are usually required to clean up after their event.

# *Responsibility:* Often a local non-profit community organisation will
# own or lease the centre, and/or be responsible for site maintenance and
# management. Governance of facilities and policy decisions can involve
# community members outside of the NPO sitting as board members in
# addition to public officials.

# *Ownership:* Private non-profit or public ownership.

# As trees grow to maturity, they change the microclimate around them.
# Deciduous trees for instance will form a shady canopy during summer and
# also provide shelter from hot winds, and then let the sun through in
# winter (ABC 2009). Trees take time to mature into a size that can afford
# shade and coolth, however, and they need to be protected to mature.
# Furthermore, mature trees can die back or die altogether, thus other
# trees need to be on their way towards maturity to take their place. It
# is therefore imperative that senescent trees, that is, trees of advanced
# old age or trees in decline, that are more susceptible to disease,
# insect infestation and decay, are responsibly managed in urban streets
# and parks and that succession tree planting is planned for (City of Ryde
# 2016, pp. 24-26). This particularly requires the development of
# expertise relating to:

# - Monitoring tree senescence patterns.
# - Staggering plantings over time.
# - Communicating clearly to park users the plans for staggered plantings,
#   and the transformative processes currently taking place.

# **** Pattern Conditions
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-40
#     :END:
# *Enablers*

# - Some Local Government Authorities are coming to realise that unplanned
#   work to remove and replace individual trees on an ad-hoc basis is
#   overly expensive and that a better solution is to develop a Tree
#   Master Plan for parks and precincts, together with a tree inventory
#   and community consultation programme (with calls for volunteering).

# *Constraints*

# - Long term plans are difficult to envision, and changes can happen too
#   slowly to be discerned sufficiently to inspire respect. Original plans
#   might be lost over time if there are not activities that ensure
#   intergenerational communication.
# - Trees may not grow as planned for. Extreme weather events can disrupt
#   long-term landscape designs.

# **** Commoning Concerns
#     :PROPERTIES:
#     :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-40
#     :END:
# *Tree planting as an activity among commoners* who create, sustain and
# are sustained by the commons

# *Ownership:* Local Government Authority.

# *Access:* All public; birdlife.

# *Use:* Better planning for tree replacement;

# *Benefit:* Maintaining coolth in microclimates; amenity of public space;

# *Care:* Local Government Authority; contracted arboriculturists;
# community volunteers.**

# Usually experts design and maintain landscapes. Users of the cooling
# services of park landscapes can be invited into the process of planning
# and assisting the realisation of landscape designs over time. Planting
# for succession can create intergenerational sense of ownership over a
# commons.

# *Note:* We can also improve passive maintenance of vegetation through
# environmental manipulation and an understanding of ecological
# succession. In this way, non-human users are also enrolled into a
# commoning ecosystem.

* Notes :ignore:

# Do we need a phase 3 that will help people work across scenarios?  E.g., if folks focus on solutions related to food security, homelessness, rivers, etc., ... w/ the conceptual map of clusters you might have commonalities between domains that would help us make links.
# [11:39 AM]Joe Corneli: E.g., river dragons + the big issue delivery would have something in common, like "Public art" or "Public information dissemination"  — but how do we ensure that it's sufficiently doable that people don't feel demoralised?
# [11:40 AM]Joe Corneli: Maybe document the actions that are people doing in the workshop and feed that back to folks as an example of public art, so that people don't feel it's impossible?
# [11:46 AM]Joe Corneli: We want OSS that's available to everyone; we want people to relinquish expertise & then apply it to settings that potentially carries a lot of value.

# If we're asking people to contribute in a full-on way we don't just want to take ideas, we want to make coordinated action.  We want to facilitate idea generation that will benefit "all".

# — Maybe bring this as a 'concern' to the tech focused workshop?
# [11:58 AM]Joe Corneli: Tech ROI headline: Something demonstrating the capacity to work w/ sharing of knowledge over time.  This will give basis to write in Hyperreal as a knowledge sharing partner over a long period of time.  Let's have a test bed for some software that offers something different.

# AT: I'm enjoying thinking about real-world challenges and how software might augment that.  The software is a tool, can I help keep this developing?  Can we take something that would demonstrate enough of its potential to a funder?

# Possible outcome from the pilots and/or full workshop, e.g., for a media or policy or knowledge-sharing journal?
# [12:03 PM]Joe Corneli: How to credit "Contributors" to workshop?  How to integrate their knowledge into the software as it develops?  Keeping in mind our hopes for the software, the idea that it can be used by anyone...
# [12:03 PM]Joe Corneli: 3:30PM on Thursday meet again — largely a strategy meeting to outline key dates, outputs, etc.
