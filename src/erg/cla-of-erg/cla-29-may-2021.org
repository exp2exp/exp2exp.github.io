* Introduction: Tools for Thought Revisited

This is a Causal Layered Analysis of the Emacs Research Group’s
activities.  Readers who aren’t familiar with /Causal Layered Analysis/
can catch up on that in the works of Sohail Inayatullah.  One of the
things we’re working on is a proper methodological introduction to how
we use this tool along with other methods.

- Input to Pattern Languages of Programs paper?
- We have a novel method that is at least somewhat inspired by ‘patterns’

This one includes data from Episodes 19-24.

* Objective for this session

- ‘What is our vision for change and how is progress measurable?’
  - /Can we get concrete about that with some sign-ups relative to the TODOs here?/

** Understanding data, headlines, empirical world (short term change) :data:
#+begin_quote
We’ve made progress since we started with the raw themes of *Research
on/in/with Emacs* back in October 2020.

We’ve met almost every week since then, and interviewed some
interesting and varied guests.  We have a clearer idea of what what we
want to talk about at the next EmacsConf, and how we can be of service
to researchers and Emacs users.  We have been using a workflow that
helps us carefully review progress, diagnose issues, and manage our
energy.  The next phase of this project is to “go public” and mesh
with ongoing related activities elsewhere.
#+end_quote
*** BACK Maintain plans for the next six months                  :breakdown:
- We are doing research
- Some more directly related to Emacs
- Some with guests
- Some ‘user’ and “market” research
- Backlink to: [[peeragogy:Roadmap]]
*** BACK Keep doing PARs and CLAs                                :breakdown:
- This is our thing about method
- Maybe we should be expanding this to patterns...?
- This could be about presenting ‘futures’ in Patterns
 - NB: in Typescript work, there was a nice description of patterns
 - They talked about how we shouldn’t blindly internalise them
*** BACK Mesh with other ongoing activities elsewhere            :breakdown:
- Stakeholders are much bigger group
- Diversity of guests
- Diversity of outreach (maybe some kids in London haven’t heard about programmers...)
- Mike wants to develop virtual assistant stack
  - Do users have to write Org Mode?
  - How can we offload some work to less-expert employees?
  - What’s the relationship to time, expertise, serendipity?
  - What’s relationship to ongoing Hyperreal activities?
  - To discuss more next week...
**** BACK Come up with a categorical treatment of todo-categories

** Systemic approaches and solutions (social system)                :system:
#+begin_quote
If we tackle big enough projects, it will bring with it the need for
collaboration.  We like to create tangible deliverables (e.g., journal
articles).  However, “If we knew what the outcome was it wouldn’t be
research” — therefore, we’re focusing initially on /research methods/
and /design documents/.  That may mean it takes us a bit longer to write
our first paper, but when we get something out it will be good.
Meanwhile we’re also keeping sharp by fixing bugs, filing issues,
improving our own workflows, and actively exploring the landscape.  We
want to keep a role for serendipity here, which adds the requirement
that our planning process remain open and flexible: including to
various disciplinary methods, and especially to change as we reflect
on how things are going.
#+end_quote
*** BACK Identify potential stakeholders in Emacs Research       :breakdown:
- ‘Org Notes’ for some potential USERS
- Other potential users, also some people we can talk to as market/user research (Not all stakeholders are users.)
- Org Roam
- Zanzi’s Smos stuff, Qiantan’s S-EXP based editor, treesitter stuff
- Standardising Org? What are the different enablers?
*** BACK Identify stakeholders in the kind of activities we can support :breakdown:
- Literature review?
- “Lisp as alien technology”
*** BACK Identify venues where we can reach these different stakeholders :breakdown:
-  (who, what is the itinerary; having places to talk about research?)
*** BACK Create some publication to plant a flag for our group   :breakdown:
- To whom could we could present preliminary and intermediate results (e.g., some people who haven’t attended every session may want to have a summary to catch up).
*** BACK Keep exploring!                                         :breakdown:
- (In terms of the Peeragogy Heartbeat concept, we have some people
  holding the fort; in this sense we are doing fine in terms of
  turn-out at weekly meetings!)
- However, to make it ‘research’ we need to make sure we keep encountering the unexpected

** Worldview, ways of knowing and alternative discourse          :worldview:
#+begin_quote
We have looked at RStudio and Roam Research as models of (some of) the
kinds of things we think Emacs can eventually improve upon.
‘Practice’ and ‘method’ keep coming up in our discussions as,
respectively, ‘more bottom up’ and ‘more top down’ ways of actualising
things.  Concretely, we’ve been studying our own processes and looking
for the tools and settings that are the most conducive to the work we
want to do.  For example, instead of having a single Org Roam
directory shared via Git, what if we had ways of managing sharing of
notes across ‘graphs’?

Collaboration is familiar to in all kinds of teams across all sectors.
Even authors working alone may have need to ‘virtually collaborate
with themselves’ — and of course to share their work with others when
it’s ready.  If we all had our slipboxes online, we could reference
between them.  This would generalise *ORCiD*, and people to reference
processes that are undergoing evolution.  Maybe a service like this
would turn into a ‘Tinder for academics’ — helping to match people
based on their interests (or similar people in different fields).  So,
what’s the price point?  Instead of paying money to go to conferences,
now we can spontaneously make conferences and workshops.  As a guess,
$750.0 per user per year might be a fair price — for those who can
afford to pay it — if the service helps people to do better research
and saves a bunch of travel.  We could also set up a pricing model
proportional to each country’s carbon emissions or something like
that.

*** BACK Spec out the Emacs based ‘answer’ to RStudio, Roam Research (not Logseq) :breakdown:
-  (It would be great if we got the next big thing up and running in a year... but this is a lot to ask.)
- But what would the “next big thing” look like at the level of, say, an ERC proposal?
*** BACK Develop our own intention-based workflow                 :breakdown:
- [x] Surfacing the experimental ground
- [ ] What else?
*** BACK Continue to develop and refine our methods               :breakdown:
- This is already incorporated with the PAR and CLA (that’s actionable)
- So would be doubling down here with a paper on our methods for PLoP
*** BACK Develop a suitable collaborative writing workflow for a specific shared output :breakdown:
*** BACK Think about the product and business development plans for a multigraph interlinking service :breakdown:
- Inyatullah would want us to think critically about what we’re saying in this document.
*** BACK Something similar with Pete Kaminsky and Lauralie ‘matching’
- Harder to do soul-matching...
- It’s not just what they need to go but what you need to avoid (or, which half of the room?)
- Use the friend magnetism to attract people (GravPad?)

** Myths, metaphors and narratives: imagined (longer term change) :narrative:
#+begin_quote
In our concrete methods, we have aligned ourselves with the ‘[[https://longtermist.substack.com/][long-term
perspective]]’.  This includes both retrospective and prospective
thinking.  For example, the things that were timely 7 years ago might
not be so timely now; in many cases the relevance of a given
innovation goes down over time.  However, Emacs has an evolutionary
character that has allowed it to keep up with the times — becoming
more relevant and useful ever since Steele and Stallman started to
systematise [[https://www.oreilly.com/openbook/freedom/ch06.html][Editor MACroS]] for the Text Editor and Corrector (TECO)
program.  Not only has the technology evolved, but so has the social
setting in which this work is done.  Whereas the concepts underlying
the free software movement were based on “[[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-paper.html][communal sharing]]” of source
code, with due reflection these methods extend much more broadly, and
allow us to synthesise new relationships within broader semiotic
commons.  Emacs can become a system for addressing any ‘existential’
problem.  This does not yet push us beyond what’s humanly possible,
but may expand the frontier of possibility.
