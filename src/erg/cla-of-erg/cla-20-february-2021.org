This refines the previous [[id:eba531ea-7a47-4dba-bdd5-045d27cf0033][CLA 16 January 2021]], which covered Episodes 1-6.
Perhaps we should delay ‘finalising’ this for a couple more weeks, so that we can also have 6 episodes to look back on.
But we might as well start now so that we don’t have to do it all at once!

* Objective for this session

‘What is our vision for change and how is progress measurable?’

** Understanding data, headlines, empirical world (short term change) :data:
#+begin_quote
- We’ve made progress since we started with the raw themes of “Research on/in/with Emacs”.
- We’ve had interesting and varied guests, and some developing plans for the quarter ahead.

** Systemic approaches and solutions (social system)                :system:
#+begin_quote
- We’ve got a workflow with careful review and diagnosis of issues when expectations aren’t met.
- Our work needs to be public first before we can embark on this project; we can mesh with ongoing related activities elsewhere.
- Looking at RStudio as a model of (some of) the kinds of things we want to do.

** Worldview, ways of knowing and alternative discourse          :worldview:
#+begin_quote
- ‘Practice’ and ‘method’ keep coming up (respectively, more bottom up and more top down ways of actualising what we’re doing). E.g., one /method/ would be: instead of having a shared Org Roam directory, having ways of managing sharing of notes across ‘graphs’.
- If we tackle big enough projects, it will bring with it the need for collaboration.
- While we like to create tangible deliverables (e.g., journal articles), “If we knew what the outcome was it wouldn’t be research” — and we want to keep a role for /serendipity/ in our work.

#+begin_quote
- What gives an objective character to what we’re doing?  Or, rather: what is it that allows us to synthesise new relationships?
