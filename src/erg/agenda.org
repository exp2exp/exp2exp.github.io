** [?] Trickle-down money from JC’s work with Abby?
** TODO Getting an evil maint to come talk some goddamn sense into Alex
- RP: We could set up a dialogue with one of those evil-mode.
- JC: We could just find someone who loves evil-mode.
- LV: I’ve asked Alex to keep track of the problems in a document for us to review it.

* ERG items from PLoP CLA 1                                 :NeedsBreakdown:
** What is this method actually useful for?
- Now we have a chance to reevaluate this method, so by now we would have a chance to have validated some things
- For the conference version, anything that we can tie up and say... this is what did work and didn’t work so we
- Just the fact that we’ve been able to meet for ≈2 hours for ≈1 year... the opportunity to work with a crew of people we know, developing /ad hoc/ behaviours like sharing feature requests in real-time for the tools we’re using...
  - This might be considered side-goals for ERG, but it’s contributing to things being done in/on/with Emacs
  - Compared with other groups, we’re much more regular and organised!
  - The way we’ve been able to work and organize has been somewhat haphazard at times, but mostly it was organized, and we could see how to improve the rough points
  - And if you want to see something very haphazard the other examples are elsewhere!
- We talked about our ability to work together as a concrete gain
- With the stack: some ideas might have been too ambitious, or had prerequisites; now, with the paper, we have a deliverable, but we’re in a place where we can get back to things like Hypernotebooks or Arxana; and with things like CRDT, we have now initiated a collaboration
- Let’s not discount the remaining Potential energy
- This is a great synthesis of human & technical skills
  - JC: This is what I want to be doing with my life!

** In addition to this, what else is needed for the paper
- Discussion needs reshuffling
- Pull things that need more work and put them in the journal version
- Let’s chat with Greta Goertz about possibly joining us as part of ERG; she’s giving a related talk

** BACK Maintain plans for the next six months                     :Roadmap:
** BACK Process the following points                             :Scrapbook:
- "Patterns all the way down meme"
- Workshop design is where JC overlapped with NA more recently, could we make an Emacs workshop?
- Keep in mind that in December is the final deadline of PLoP, so we can report on progress then
** BACK Keep doing PARs and CLAs                                :Assessment:
- This is nice even if just for regularity
  - Recurring activities which are very small lead to compounding effects later on
  - E.g., "Paradise Lost" memorization verse-by-verse leads to something bigger than the sum of the parts
- But there may also be some specific gains
  - They impact the way we think
  - Cf. "self-reflexive attitude towards our own learning" from teacher-training methods
  - CLA and PAR are two ways to consider this, and develop those behaviours
  - (Similar with meditation, more so than swimming.)
- It feels like we’re making progress

** BACK Mesh with other ongoing activities elsewhere           :Cooperation:
- EmacsConf 2023
- Other Emacs groups
- Peeragogy
- CRDT development
- PLACARD workshop
- ...
- Which activities elsewhere?
- Start also by thinking about individuals like Greta

** BACK Identify potential stakeholders in Emacs Research        :Community:
- Keeping in mind health and well-being as a prerequisite for doing what we love!
- Starting with outreach
- We hope others will do things like ours
- Crazy stretch goal: Emacs Research Journal with quarterly reports

** BACK Identify stakeholders in the kind of activities we can support :ASpecificProject:
*** Goals
- How should we share/disseminate what we’ve done?
- Publicise some?  Private meetings?
*** Progress
- We have done this with EmacsConf
- Joe gave a 30 minute version of that talk at Brookes
*** Tech note:
Org mode is less good at keeping track of ongoing/recurring/progressive tasks


** BACK Identify venues where we can reach these different stakeholders :Wrapper:
** BACK Create some publication to plant a flag for our group        :Paper:
- PLoP paper has been progressed! ✓
** BACK Spec out the Emacs based ‘answer’ to RStudio, Roam Research :Community:
** BACK Keep exploring                                         :Serendipity:
** BACK Develop our own intention-based workflow                     :Forum:
** BACK Continue to develop and refine our methods              :Assessment:
** BACK Product and business development plans for a multigraph interlinking service :Website:
- Maybe we need this to keep our items organised
- Could we prototype some of this stuff with a modern graph database?
- What about Spivak’s version of a database? is CQL somehow relevant...
- /Relates to/ [[Come up with a categorical treatment of todo-categories]]
*** Manage the technical issues within ORG mode
- =make-anchor= + =insert-link-to-anchor=
- If we can at least get them linking with each other
** BACK A tool to find and match peers/content                 :RECOMMENDER:
** BACK Survey related work                                        :Context:
- We have a Related work section of the paper and [[Reading groups and seminars]]
** BACK Assess what we’re learning                              :Assessment:
** BACK Think about how we can help improve gender balance in Free Software :DIVERSITY:
- Relates to [[Create some publication to plant a flag for our group]] since we reference some people who talk about this
* WONT ERG items from PLoP CLA Review 20/11                       
** Peeragogy?
But they might not be ready to do this yet, so it remains an aspiration
*** BACK New user workshops: “Zero to Org Roam”                   :Newcomer:
:PROPERTIES:
:Subproject: ERG
:END:
- Are we minting the newcomer?  Or is the the next step for them?  What’s the next step for us?
- Can we use some algorithmic thinking, rather than just with structured data?
- 300 instances of "Newcomer" isn’t that relevant
** Come back to after six months have gone by?
*** BACK How can we manage a large distributed set of Org files? :FormalPatterns:
- War Room metaphor for open source
- Joe could work on this in one of his grant proposals and report back on any progress
- We might have other little steps forward that help us do this
