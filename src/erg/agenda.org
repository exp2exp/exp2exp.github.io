* ERG items from PLoP CLA 1                                 :NeedsBreakdown:
** BACK Process the following points                             :Scrapbook:
- "Patterns all the way down meme"
- Workshop design is where JC overlapped with NA more recently, could we make an Emacs workshop?
- Keep in mind that in December is the final deadline of PLoP, so we can report on progress then
** BACK Maintain plans for the next six months                     :Roadmap:
** BACK Keep doing PARs and CLAs                                :Assessment:
** BACK Mesh with other ongoing activities elsewhere           :Cooperation:
** BACK New user workshops: “Zero to Org Roam”                    :Newcomer:
:PROPERTIES:
:Subproject: ERG
:END:
- Are we minting the newcomer?  Or is the the next step for them?  What’s the next step for us?
- Can we use some algorithmic thinking, rather than just with structured data?
- 300 instances of "Newcomer" isn’t that relevant
** BACK Come up with a categorical treatment of todo-categories :FormalPatterns:
** BACK Identify potential stakeholders in Emacs Research        :Community:
** BACK Identify stakeholders in the kind of activities we can support :ASpecificProject:
- How should we share/disseminate what we’ve done?
- Publicise some?  Private meetings?
** BACK Identify venues where we can reach these different stakeholders :Wrapper:
** BACK Create some publication to plant a flag for our group        :Paper:
- PLoP paper has been progressed! ✓
** BACK Keep exploring                                         :Serendipity:
** BACK Spec out the Emacs based ‘answer’ to RStudio, Roam Research :Community:
** BACK Develop our own intention-based workflow                     :Forum:
** BACK Continue to develop and refine our methods              :Assessment:
** BACK Product and business development plans for a multigraph interlinking service :Website:
- Maybe we need this to keep our items organised
- Could we prototype some of this stuff with a modern graph database?
- What about Spivak’s version of a database? is CQL somehow relevant...
- /Relates to/ [[Come up with a categorical treatment of todo-categories]]
*** Manage the technical issues within ORG mode
- =make-anchor= + =insert-link-to-anchor=
- If we can at least get them linking with each other
** BACK A tool to find and match peers/content                 :RECOMMENDER:
** BACK Survey related work                                        :Context:
- We have a Related work section of the paper and [[Reading groups and seminars]]
** BACK Assess what we’re learning                              :Assessment:
** BACK Think about how we can help improve gender balance in Free Software :DIVERSITY:
- Relates to [[Create some publication to plant a flag for our group]] since we reference some people who talk about this
