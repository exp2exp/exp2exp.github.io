** Project Action Review (weekly)
#+begin_src
1. Review the intention: what do we expect to learn or make together?
2. Establish what is happening: what and how are we learning?
3. What are some different perspectives on what’s happening?
4. What did we learn or change?
5. What else should we change going forward?
#+end_src
** Causal Layered Analysis (every six weeks)
#+begin_src
1. Litany
2. System
3. Worldview
4. Myth
#+end_src
** Design Patterns (as needed, and linked with TODO items)
#+begin_src
1. Context
2. Problem
3. Solution
4. Next steps
#+end_src

* OUTCOMES

** Patterns of Patterns (PLoP 2021)

#+begin_quote
The purpose of this paper is to show how we can combine and adapt
methods from elite training, future studies, and collaborative design,
and apply them to address significant problems in social networks.

** Initial user studies

Guests included:

 - Alex Murphy MSc in Data Analytics, beginning Emacs user
 - Mark Dawson of M-x Research
 - Qiantan Hong, developer of crdt.el

Building on these conversations we would like to do more interviews,
and eventually be able to say:

- ‘If you are someone who does X, these are the packages that would work for you’

** Broader context

- We’re working on various different topics in different overlapping contexts
- We’re trying to share common PATTERNS and ideas that work well across these different contexts.
- E.g.,

  - /Every meeting should have an optional checkin so that people can update on anything important/.
  - /A five minute lightning talk is an example of an extended checkin./
  - /Apart from checkins, meetings should have only 1 or 2 main topics so that we don’t get overwhelmed./
  - ... and so on.

- (Some of this could feed back into updating the Peeragogy Handbook’s Realtime Meetings section!)
* CONCLUSION

You should consider creating your own small research communities
similar to ours!

- The patterns we’ve been learning are all shared and we’re open to feedback.
