- The four of us met at EmacsConf 2020 with a common interest in Emacs and research.
- We’ve met almost every week since then, because we wanted to keep the conversation going.
- In this short talk, we share information about the methods we use,
  making a case for other people getting together and creating their
  own small research communities similar to ours.
* BACKGROUND AND TECHNOLOGY
- We wanted an Emacs-centric solution for real-time meetings

3. What are some different perspectives on what’s happening?
4. What did we learn or change?
5. What else should we change going forward?
