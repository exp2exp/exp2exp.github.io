Moving outside the sphere of the ‘vocal’, since, within everything to
do with language we seem to have preferred quantity to coherence or
development.  Another take on the question of how to see the coherence
that is otherwise invisible.  Looking for different perspectives is
the basic operation.  However we also need to learn to think
long-term, because simply staging a conversation puts us in the sense
of immediacy.  And in this regard: we start to consider what it would
mean to look at the future.  Whereas we are grounded in the present,
and we have a circumspect if somewhat dim view of the past, we seem
embarassed about the future.  And yet if we think about it again, the
future offers us many good things (here, a bit like /Roadside Picnic/).
Coming around to the position of regarding the future with out
prejudice: understanding that it articulates itself better than we
might think; and opening ourselves to the future.
