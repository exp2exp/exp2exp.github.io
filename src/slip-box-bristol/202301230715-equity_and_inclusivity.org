‘Inclusive/exclusive’ wasn’t one of the six enumerated [[id:59798017-b0af-473e-bdcd-108a8ef1e06d][Productive
tensions]] but it is nevertheless a tension that is closely related to
those.

* The tension

- To be part of a group
- To be experience in relation to one another

- To be yourself in public
- To have a sense of self that is nevertheless not alone
- (The character of the [[id:f73ea1a7-823b-4847-ad0f-141cd2af0049][Flaneur]] is representative here.)
