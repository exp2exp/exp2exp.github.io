This dimension is often related to the dimension of being [[id:3628d209-8777-4dae-ae27-4acdb252dfca][Fixed]], since
the design often assumes that the system will function in one way, and
in any case cannot fully take account of the unexpected.

‘Design’ typically means a response to understood, present, economic needs.

It works to ‘predict’ the future, and may constrain it.  Here is is
opposed to spontaneous, undesigned organisation which senses the
future through ‘anticipation’ rather than determining.

- [[id:fda9acc7-f49e-48ca-bf45-a2909e2ec6ed][Governance]] could be both an example (something that is designed) and a way of implementing other designs.
