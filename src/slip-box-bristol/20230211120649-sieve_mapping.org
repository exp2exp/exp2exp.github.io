Known as ‘landscape suitability analysis’ or sometimes just as
‘sieve-mapping’, the technique he developed involved layering
information on acetate sheets. So, for example, in considering the
optimal route for a new highway, McHarg would combine layers showing
the engineering properties of the substrates with layers showing
productive soils, significant wildlife habitats, important cultural
sites, and so on. When these were combined, it was the areas which
were clearest of symbols that were the better areas in which to
construct the road. — https://landscapetheory1.wordpress.com/tag/ian-mcharg/
