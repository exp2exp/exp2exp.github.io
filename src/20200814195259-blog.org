For now we’re just maintaining a /blog roll/ rather than one shared blog

#+begin_quote
Zans: /If I implemented as I read things, it would be a pretty interesting blog. There could be a huge market of people interested in following this, this would give a pool of people who know who we are. This is a nice goal b/c it doesn't focus on the product... but it's a deliverable, made up of smaller deliverables, and a concrete benefit./
