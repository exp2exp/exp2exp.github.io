This refines the previous [[file:cla-16-january-2021.org][CLA 16 January 2021]], which covered Episodes
1-6, and [[file:cla-20-february-2021.org][CLA 20 February 2021]] which covered Episodes 7-12.  This one,
additionally, covers Episodes 13-18.  Now that we have been over this
territory a bit, it makes sense to try and develop some breakdown of
the text we’ve developed into doable, measurable, tasks.

* Objective for this session

‘What is our vision for change and how is progress measurable?’

** Understanding data, headlines, empirical world (short term change) :data:
#+begin_quote
We’ve made progress since we started with the raw themes of “Research
on/in/with Emacs”.  We’ve had interesting and varied guests, and some
developing plans for the quarter ahead.  We’ve got a workflow with
careful review and diagnosis of issues when expectations aren’t met.
Our work needs to be public first before we can embark on the next
phase of this project — which is to mesh with ongoing related
activities elsewhere.

#+begin_quote
If we tackle big enough projects, it will bring with it the need for
collaboration (who, what is the itinerary; having places to talk about
research?). While we like to create tangible deliverables (e.g.,
journal articles, rather than half-baked/half-finished publications),
“If we knew what the outcome was it wouldn’t be research” — and we
want to keep a role for serendipity in our work. (Good to have some
people holding the fort; we’re doing fine in terms of turn-out at
weekly meetings!)

** Worldview, ways of knowing and alternative discourse          :worldview:
#+begin_quote
We have looked at RStudio as a model of (some of) the kinds of things
we want to do (would be great if we got the next big thing up and
running in a year... but this is a lot to ask). ‘Practice’ and
‘method’ keep coming up (respectively, these seem to be more bottom up
and more top down ways of actualising what we’re doing).  We’ve been
focusing on what we’re actually doing, and when we’re clear on that,
we look at which settings are the most conducive. E.g., one method
would be: instead of having a shared Org Roam directory, having ways
of managing sharing of notes across ‘graphs’. (Collaborative work,
academia, writing a book; ORCiD. If we all had our slipboxes on there
we could reference between them. Finding things which are continually
evolving. Maybe it would turn into a Tinder for academics to match
people based on interest... Instead of paying money to go to
conferences! Now we can spontaneously make up conferences. That will
be $750.0 per user...)

What gives an objective character to what we’re doing? (Noting also
that time is going by; things that were timely 7 years ago might not
be timely now; the actual relevance goes down.) Or, rather: what is it
that allows us to synthesise new relationships? What big or
‘existential’ problem are we solving... we’re not pushing ourselves
beyond what’s humanly possible, but we are pushing ourselves to
learn.
