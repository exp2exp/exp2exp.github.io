This refines the previous [[file:cla-16-january-2021.org][CLA 16 January 2021]], which covered Episodes
1-6, and [[file:cla-20-february-2021.org][CLA 20 February 2021]] which covered Episodes 7-12.  This one,
additionally, covers Episodes 13-18.  Now that we have been over this
territory a bit, it may make sense to try and develop some breakdown
of the /text/ that we’ve developed into doable, measurable, tasks.
Notice that the supporting evidence from our previous PARs shows the
kinds of things that we are capable of doing, so in some sense they
foreshadow the kinds of =TODO= items that we could be slating for
further work.

* Objective for this session

‘What is our vision for change and how is progress measurable?’

** Understanding data, headlines, empirical world (short term change) :data:
#+begin_quote
We’ve made progress since we started with the raw themes of *Research on/in/with Emacs*.

We’ve had interesting and varied guests, and some developing plans for
the quarter ahead.  We’ve got a workflow with careful review and
diagnosis of issues when expectations aren’t met.  Our work needs to
be public first before we can embark on the next phase of this project
— which is to mesh with ongoing related activities elsewhere.
#+end_quote
*** BACK Maintain plans for the quarter ahead?
- We are doing research
- Some more directly related to Emacs
- Some with guests
- Some ‘user’ and “market” research
*** BACK Keep doing PARs and CLAs?
- This is our thing about method
- Maybe we should be expanding this to patterns...?
- This could be about presenting ‘futures’ in Patterns
 - NB: in Typescript work, there was a nice description of patterns
 - They talked about how we shouldn’t blindly internalise them
*** BACK Mesh with other ongoing activities elsewhere?
- Stakeholders are much bigger group
- Diversity of guests
- Diversity of outreach (maybe some kids in London haven’t heard about programmers...)
- Mike wants to develop virtual assistant stack
  - Do users have to write Org Mode?
  - How can we offload some work to less-expert employees?
  - What’s the relationship to time, expertise, serendipity?
  - What’s relationship to ongoing Hyperreal activities?
  - To discuss more next week...

** Systemic approaches and solutions (social system)                :system:
#+begin_quote
If we tackle big enough projects, it will bring with it the need for
collaboration (who, what is the itinerary; having places to talk about
research?). While we like to create tangible deliverables (e.g.,
journal articles, rather than half-baked/half-finished publications),
“If we knew what the outcome was it wouldn’t be research” — and we
want to keep a role for serendipity in our work. (Good to have some
people holding the fort; we’re doing fine in terms of turn-out at
weekly meetings!)
#+end_quote
*** BACK Identify potential stakeholders in Emacs Research
- ‘Org Notes’ for some potential USERS
- Other potential users, also some people we can talk to as market/user research (Not all stakeholders are users.)
- Org Roam
- Zanzi’s Smos stuff, Qiantan’s S-EXP based editor, treesitter stuff
- Standardising Org? What are the different enablers?
*** BACK Identify stakeholders in the kind of activities we can support
- Literature review?
- “Lisp as alien technology”
*** BACK Create some publication to plant a flag for our group
*** BACK Keep exploring!

#+begin_quote
We have looked at RStudio as a model of (some of) the kinds of things
we want to do (would be great if we got the next big thing up and
running in a year... but this is a lot to ask). ‘Practice’ and
‘method’ keep coming up (respectively, these seem to be more bottom up
and more top down ways of actualising what we’re doing).  We’ve been
focusing on what we’re actually doing, and when we’re clear on that,
we look at which settings are the most conducive. E.g., one method
would be: instead of having a shared Org Roam directory, having ways
of managing sharing of notes across ‘graphs’. (Collaborative work,
academia, writing a book; ORCiD. If we all had our slipboxes on there
we could reference between them. Finding things which are continually
evolving. Maybe it would turn into a Tinder for academics to match
people based on interest... Instead of paying money to go to
conferences! Now we can spontaneously make up conferences. That will
be $750.0 per user...)
#+end_quote
*** BACK Spec out the Emacs based ‘answer’ to RStudio, Roam Research (not Logseq)
*** BACK Develop our own intention-based workflow
- Surfacing the experimental ground?
*** BACK Continue to develop and refine our methods
- This is already incorporated with the PAR and CLA (that’s actionable)
- So would be doubling down here with a paper on our methods for PLoP
*** BACK Develop a suitable collaborative writing workflow for a specific shared output
*** BACK Think about the product and business development plans for a multigraph interlinking service

be timely now; the actual relevance goes down.) Or, rather: what is it
