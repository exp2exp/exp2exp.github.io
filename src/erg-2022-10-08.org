* 08 October 2022  — Emacs Research Group


* Check-ins
:PROPERTIES:
:Effort:   0:15
:END:

** NA
- feeling under the weather; most likely seasonal cold/allergies
- We featured in Noorah’s dreams!  Leo showed up half-naked...; Joe accused NA of stealing his book which was Belgium’s constitution.
  - LV: Not too unrealistic, and besides Joe does love his books
  - JC: Dreams are cool :-)
  - NA: People are usually harbingers of something else...

** JC
- Feels sorry about the low-energy from last week (but everything’s fine!)

** LV
- Doing fine, has a wound on his shin from biking
- Weekending progresses apace


* Meta points

** TODO Don't forget to record the session!                             :LV:

** TODO Pre-PAR — Review the intention: what do we expect to learn or make together?
- We had ‘almost’ created a recurring meeting with Abby, but she was quite busy with the start of the semester.
- We had a lot of meetings w/ her prior to the semester starting
  - Thursday best for NA and probably all of us.

* Agenda (Part 1): “Review of workshop”
:PROPERTIES:
:Effort:   0:15
:END:

** What do we need from Abby?
- A list of attendees, for both workshops.
- [[patterns][Patterns]].
- Do we want different list of requirements between this proto-workshop and the future ones?

** JC’s further work on patterns
<<patterns>>
- We can review this today and ask Abby for her thoughts as well on Thursday

Collective review:
- brittleness?
- chaos as a pattern
- trivial: partic*-*ipants?
- Our ship metaphor is building on other ship metaphors (like the /polis/ as a ship for the Ancient Greeks)
- Dissolving boundaries : “we only see nature as something to consume”

** Feedback on ¶: Patterns, Dissolving boundaries, etc.
- It sums up a lot of our common ground to create a good working environment (e.g., ‘the ocean’)
- But, regarding the workshop itself, thinking about ‘social contract’ and ‘X contract’, I’m not sure how relevant it is for our presentation of the workshop methods...
- We need to be careful about what we put in the heads of participants when we get started
- Some of the things will be thought-provoking, but if we talk too much about ‘dissolving boundaries’ (removing identity as well as expertise)
  - People may be too aware of the process...!
- Some of the points ought to be mentioned *before we start the workshop* (_a blurb_); some of the things might need to be communicated *after the workshop* to explain why

- JC: also the *midway point* where we’ll introduce different things to different people

- If we talk about ‘dissolution of self relative to environment’ — this should be entirely done by Phase I
  - "This is what allowed us to go to the very bottom of the problem as citizens"
  - "As we’re now going to mobilise your expertise, be aware that we’ve now dissolved the boundaries between all of you; we’ve also dissolved you with regard to your environment"

* BREAK

* Agenda (Part 2): "All tech business"
:PROPERTIES:
:Effort:   0:15
:END:

** Idea: AM’s tech-demo?
- If you type a word, it will recognise that it’s a dog...
- But there’s no further brain...

** Implementation: Walk through of Joe’s grant

- Features of text tools:
  - Add concept modelling (based on Noorah’s work)

- s/playes/plays/

* PAR

:Effort:   0:10
:END:

*** 1. Establish what is happening: what and how are we learning?
- We’re taking a laid-back *meeting*, staying to about one hour
- JC: Perfect day here in the UK
  - NA: Antidote to the SADs!
- LV: I decided to share a little less and focus on what I want to share rather than having constant logorhea... I don’t need to steal the show w/ a long rant about X and Y. 
  - JC: Mind can create pain or make it go away, apparently.
    - LV: I wish I could wish away pain!
    - NA: I hate how much it distracts you from other things
      - LV: It’s like a buzzing fly, it doesn’t produce a lot of noise, but it can be still annoying partly because there’s no pattern

*** 2. What are some different perspectives on what's happening?
- NA: How do you do the emojis?
- LV: Emojis look wrong in Org Bullets!
  - I used to love Nyan cat but I realised it was very distacting
    - JC: Let’s not over-design our stuff

*** 3. What did we learn or change?

- "Fly" is feminine in both Arabic and French
  - NA: I can guess the gender of French words based on Arabic
    - LV: It’s possible that there are language borrowings
- Sun/Moon gender is opposite in French and German

- LV: I recommend the retelling of "The Stranger" from a different perspective by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamel_Daoud][Kamel Daoud]]
  - NA: Worth rereading "The Stranger"

- LV: I read "The Plague" ("La Peste") by Camus before Covid!

- LV: "When Annie Ernaux says ‘I’, the reader feels ‘we’."

*** 4. What else should we change going forward?
- More chat time is good
- Short sessions sometimes are OK

* Tentative agenda for next week

- Meeting with Abby
- EmacsConf Conference
- Workshop
- JC: I want to share my Google Calendar for the week on Monday so I don’t miss important things
- NA: Won’t be around next Saturday
  -
