* 19 December 2020 — Emacs Research Group
** Methodology
*** Real-time syncing side
Survey of different options for synchronous notes w/ Org Mode.

*Promising:*

- crdt.el — for syncronizing sessions w/ SSH & port forwarding; library for replication across buffers
 - a bit early
 - Qiantan might be interested to join our sessions
 - The approach is one that synchronises anything that Emacs does
 - Maybe in a year we'll have a good package

Etherpad is tried and tested! Works for up to 100 people.

- linepad.el — Making Emacs into a frontend of Etherpad.
 - But it didn't really work!

*** Publishing side
This can be sorted out much more quickly.

- Org Roam notes online, various tech options already exist
- Git repos work already; sometimes need to resolve edit conflicts if multiple people edit the same files.
- We can generally write atomic files / trees, so we don't run into many conflicts
- Works with netlify to publish to the web
- We might want to develop a structured way of writing
- Pronunciation: /paragogy/ vs /peeragogy/ vs /pairagogy/ (Fr.)
*** Meetings
- Meeting times (e.g. 5PM? 5:30PM?)
- Invitations for special guests
- Possibly open enrolment once things are set up
- when compared with EmacsConf: ERG keeps opening up ideas, and not doing pruning, or, there's more to prune.
- How do we want meetings to go e.g., 2nd of January?
- Do we want to do a couple months that are private, but give ourselves a deadline?
- Once we get notes going, people will be able to read and give them contact info; and inviting people in as needed.
*** Outputs and style of working of the group
- Writing research reports + whitepaper(s)
 - The exact format & presentation depends on audience
  - Emacs community?
  - Academics?
  - Our peers?
- Getting people using Emacs
- Podcast where we discuss conclusions? (Including 20mins debrief of procedures.)
- 1ce a month deep dive into things like crdt.el (or other packages) with the author.
 - "When I wrote this what is my vision?"
 - When we explain the motivation behind a package it makes people want to use it more
 - Overlap with Emacs Lisp group (for package managers)
 - Users + potential users can supply feedback
 - Does this belong to ERG?  As a seminar.  Of interest, but we want to do some other things too.
  - Stats, CS, social science seminars might look different
  - Being a slow version of EmacsConf?
  - We're rather amorphous (not bound to official university requirements)
  - We're presently more of a think tank, thinking about options
  - Digital Humanities? CS? Etc.; not everyone will attend every seminar
  - Can have different populations even w/in same faculty
- What infrastructure can we make that will facilitate people coming to the right talks?
 - Keep track of the various streams of interests
- Cf. RGCS Research Group on Collaborative Spaces
 - Could be linked to peeragogy
 - "Place of statues within urban landscape"
 - "Open Science & publishing reproducible research"
 - Topics are a bit far apart but there's some cohesion as well
 - We could follow a similar style
- Make sure to have a defined process/aims so that people know what to expect
 - At first we might want a limited set of people who we know will make it to the topics
- Online academic world is still in a primordial soup of COVID-proof workflows
 - Build a presence in the online landscape

** Early future for the project
*** Monthly schedule
- If we do a seminar, we expose a lot about ourselves and how we do research
 - This could be a good "shock and awe" method: people can copy us
 - This will give a good way to get better
*** Whitepaper: How to structure?
- If we try a first draft we may get somewhere.
- (Org Roam doesn't yet have a proper manual!)
*** Bridges to Peeragogy + writing there
- Make Emacs accessible to people who edit the Handbook
- Section on Emacs w/in Peeragogy
- May want to circumscribe the two so it’s not too evangelistic
- How to support the peeragogy community in learning how to use the format
 - And potentially more of Emacs
 - How to get peer learning to get peeragogues to use Emacs
- Move towards evangelising to other colleagues (in digital humanities &c.)?
- Possibly defining ERG as a group of people w/ expertise in peer learning & collaborative work
 - LV: “Reflection on research” become a specialty for me
 - How to organize a research group? Can feed into Emacs as well
 - As someone who’s worked on methods
*** Define activities of the group
- Looking at Emacs as an entire system: has anyone tried to categorize?
 - What's used, who uses them, what are the motivations? What outputs? Etc.
 - There have been such attempts: alphapapa wrote a guide for package developers
 - Emacs for writers: article exists
 - Is this something we ought to be doing...? — How would you categorize it?
 - What is Org Roam? Magit? Etc.
 - Look at tags (keywords)
  - How have the packages & their use evolved?
  - Analogy with "Mathematical People"
 - What is Emacs (since 1985 or whatever)
  - How has it evolved? (E.g., using a biology of software systems method!)

*** Art & Science of Documentation
- What if we made students go into the repos & use the packages and rewrite the docs from a user perspective?
 - RSP: Reminds me of Math Reviews: in maths they have an org that reads papers & writes summaries
 - LV: These efforts can be bad for documentation
  - Excited new users go on IRC and say "I like Org Roam!"
   - They are often told to "go write documentation"
  - For people who have the ability to do research... we have a way of writing and seeing flaws...
  - For BA students, it's a little complicated. Technical writing takes effort.
  - *If* students want to do this, then get them doing it!
 - JAC: Extreme view: What would an /Emacs Journal/ look like?
  - Maybe start with the in-depth sessions, this could turn into a monograph.
  - Bringing the package developer to talk could help
  - "I want to know how to use this package but no idea how!"
  - This is a problem we can address!
  - LV: This would make the field legitimate! Or, a monograph! This is something we could do. We are researchers in different fields...!
   - E.g., "how does Zettlekasten w/ OR help your research?"
   - "How is Emacs a platform for packages...?"
   - This could be striking gold — making a list of potential papers
   - E.g., "The Rise of Roam" "Do all roads lead to Roam?"
   - Thinking about ideas of papers
** When to meet next? Not December 26th, but yes SATURDAY 2nd; 17:30-19:30 UTC

- ACTIONS
 - List interests we have as a group!
 - Keeping in mind
- Condense 1st hour with key bullets

** Review

*** Review the intention: what do we expect to learn or make together?
**** Start to set up next year’s agenda
**** Work on methodology of the group
*** Establish what is happening: what and how are we learning?
**** Continued on the trend of pruning things out
**** Needed to narrow our focus so we can broaden later
*** What are some different perspectives on what’s happening?
**** Seminars & Emacs journal
**** Nice thinking about a standard method that can accomodate different kinds of topics
**** Focus of small group & connections to the rest of the world looking good
*** What did we learn or change?
**** Listening!
**** How to open up? — Somewhat technical discussions take time to absorb
**** "I+1 vs I+10"
**** Felt a degree of coherence
*** What else should we change going forward?
**** Ability to show demos on Emacs is always there and a potentially good style
**** Have a nice language for asking for demo material, or other needs
**** Would be nice to have 2 screenshares (but BBB can’t do this simulatenously)
**** OBS could forward screens to webcam, but it’s finicky... still, interesting to develop this!  How to suggest features for other infrastructure
**** To think about talks we might like to give (for weeks we don’t get invited speakers)
