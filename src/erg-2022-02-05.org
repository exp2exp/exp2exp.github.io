You really need a <Compose> key

Not everything can be done with Emacs, regardless of how much time we‚Äôre sinking into it. üôÉ

#+begin_src 
LV: Waiting to connect‚Ä¶

Not sure what‚Äôs going on on my end; it‚Äôs taking ages to load the page.
Just stuck here: https://paste.xinu.at/pC6Z/

Might I suggest Discord whilst I get things working here?
I can join via phone... Ray says hi.
I‚Äôm on Discord and BBB.
#+end_src

*** Actual checkin

Since pre-2 y.o., I slept 10 hours a day 5 days in a row. Working to enshrine 10 hours of sleeping now!
Not sure if it‚Äôs the key component or what, but now I am back preparing properly for the interview, clocking 6 hours of work daily on the interview prep.

- Agenda is wonderfully clear
- Not using Org Roam, would need to start afresh with a new folder refiling everything
- Had a 3hr session with QH and we‚Äôve now switched to the upstream
- QH & LV are sharing an Org-based kanban and have been getting a lot done

** RP 

- Can‚Äôt stay long but here to say hi for the check-in!
- Is busy with research in math & bio, this month is hectic

* Meta points

** DONE Don't forget to record the session!                             :LV:

* Agenda (Part 1)                                                       :15m:

** Leo‚Äôs reports on CRDT
- Would like also to make this interactive to do a 5-10 minute onboarding to the new version for Noorah

JC: This worked for me:
#+begin_src 
git clone https://code.librehq.com/qhong/crdt.el.git
cd crdt.el
git branch -r | grep -v '\->' | sed "s,\x1B\[[0-9;]*[a-zA-Z],,g" | while read remote; do git branch --track "${remote#origin/}" "$remote"; done
git fetch --all
git pull --all
git checkout development
#+end_src

* BREAK                                                                  :0m:

* Agenda (Part 2)                                                       :15m:

** CRDT Adventure continues

What happened: Qiantan has updated the thing overnight, so we all had to pull (except Noorah!).

We interacted with it:

#+begin_quote
LV: I try typing something
JC: (It‚Äôs not the same from my side, but it might appear the same as Leo‚Äôs!)
#+end_quote

Update on the hacking progress: remove any chance of middle-man attacks, using encryption with GNU TLS.
:HIDDEN:
it‚Äôs not going 100% yet
:END:

Strengthening desync, better coordination, better debug

** Plan upcoming
Could submit something for 15th February, to write something of 1000 words

Action: Let‚Äôs table the discussion of this; we could meet during the week.

  
* PAR                                                                    :8m:

*** 1. Review the intention: what did we expect to learn or make together?
- NA: I don‚Äôt know
- JC: We wanted to have the meeting be short
- We wanted to update CRDT

*** 2. Establish what is happening: what and how are we learning?
- JC: We had some hiccups with crdt.el which had to be debugged live.
- LV: Joe did a machine-gun style presentation on Anticipation 2022 that was a bit hard to follow

*** 3. What are some different perspectives on what's happening?
- LV: We shouldn‚Äôt be making the first question in the PAR about repeating the agenda; perhaps good note-taking is invalidating the need for question 1.
- JC: One-hour session isn‚Äôt impossible to work with
- LV: But we did only dabble with some topics; in my life, I plan for 8 hours, but actually aim to get 6 hours of work done.  Meeting of 1h30 works because we get 1h of actual meeting out of this.
- We had thought to meet once to refine the agenda

*** 4. What did we learn or change?
- JC: We‚Äôve got acquainted with ourselves working at a father pace (helium + cocaine, could be a good/bad idea...)

*** 5. What else should we change going forward?
- JC: We look forward to a more leisurely-paced meeting next week.
   - Maybe try to set the agenda by Friday
- We do plan another meeting during the week at some point to look at Anticipation?

* Tentative agenda for next week
- NA: I propose we revise PAR questions (what's working and what needs to be modified)

* Check-out                                                              :2m:

** NA
- Going to Fredericksburg, TX next week, will have iPad
- Militant with sleep
- Interested in Python too!

** JC
- Will hopefully meet this week with Zaid Hassan (cofounder of Reos)
- Did appreciate NA‚Äôs dive into Reos
- Slept through the night 3 nights in a row, yay!
  - NA: We are healing our minds!

** LV
- My mind is looking for an expression... Flanders has an idiom for this
- Looking forward to a week of diligence
