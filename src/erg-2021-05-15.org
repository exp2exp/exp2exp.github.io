We usually meet for 2 hours, starting 17:30 UK time.

As a template, we have one special guest, one extra topic, a PAR,
and some informal chat. We take notes into the agenda using crdt.

(Details vary per session.)

* 15 May 2021 — Emacs Research Group

* Check-ins                                                             :20m:

** Raymond
- Has looked into getting BBB working on Chrome, but that’s nontrivial
- Has verified that the bio conference is going ahead — so Ray, Cameron, and Ximo are out 12th June (to prep for June 14th presentation)
- Week following will be attending bio talks
- This leads into the talk about reproducibility
*** TODO 12th is a Saturday off!
** Leo
- Checkin: we have seen one another every day for the last 5 days, so only minor updates to checkins from the week
- Feeling less of the vaccine presence, but can still muster some hilarity
- Today: sending the CEO of the startup a message since it’s been a month
** Joe
- Feeling good now! — but it was a stressful week.
- Took most of Saturday off.
- Started reading Inyatula (?).
- Noticed that we got the jump on Discord’s rebranding with Hyperreal rebranding.

* Things to keep in mind
** Record the sodding session

** JC & RSP: Arxana retrospective via slides                           :50m:
Somehow a simple example:
#+begin_src clojure
Leo KNOWS Ray → Leo (knows from_Emacsconf) Ray
              → Leo [ (knows from_Emacsconf) 
                       first_meeting ] Ray

              → Leo [ (knows from_Emacsconf) 
                       ( first_meeting 
                         of many ) ]
                 Ray

              → ( Leo :as group_organizer )
                 [ (knows from_Emacsconf) 
                       ( first_meeting 
                         of many ) ]
                 ( Ray :as programmer )

;; We have now built up an object that we can refer to

  { ( Leo :as group_organizer )
     [ (knows from_Emacsconf) 
           ( first_meeting 
             of many ) ]
     ( Ray :as programmer ) } ( is_known_to based_on observation )  Noorah }
                 
? Does Noorah know Ray → Yes
? Who are all the people that Leo knows from EmacsConf → Amin, Ray, Joe, Sacha...
#+end_src
*** Reaction
- LV: I understand more about what you mean about qualifying links
- Married, divorced, judging the relation itself — this all made sense
- The problem, beyond the formalism in the initial slides (I could only grok the example!)
- I’m still failing to see how from the operational level of managing notes, how is this beneficial
  - The adjectivisation of links seems abstractly useful
  - But the endless abstractivisation of a relation, how does this help the model
  - Grasping reality comes with atomisation of the conceptual frame work
  - E.g., in Org Roam we work with links and nodes, there’s no conception of a ‘verb’
  - You could create SVO with a new node e.g. *A comparison of Org Roam and Arxana*
- You could think of this in the link description system we mentioned, but nodes and links allow this to happen organically
- You could still find the ‘comparison’ node (via backlinks) from the various places
- So, the complex links aren’t necessary
- Joe: AI vs HCI; and philosophical orientation to modelling process
  - E.g., how does a mathematician solve problems?
  - How do I think through this problem to come to a solution?
  - We tried to represent this, and have the computer be able to follow this
  - Not just representing /deductive logic/ but also the induction, abduction, reasoning — “mathematical intuition”
- LV: So, this feels like a dissection tool rather than a tool for representing knowledge
- It reminds me of ‘hyperlist’ — a way to describe any example in pseudocode
- LV has an example for his washing machine
  - Explaining things, the concept of flowchart
  - If JC and RSP had introduced it this way, LV would have been better primed
  - ‘Language’ would have carried better — a tool for description + AI
  - Now this makes more sense — it’s drifting apart from an equivalence with “Org Roam”
  - But perhaps Arxana is more of a ‘tool’ that can inform Org Roam 
  - Arxana could be a way of relating nodes in a complex way that allows you to complete the relations between the two
- RSP: It started with Noosphere and hypertext but then got into AI 
- JC: Namecheck Douglas Adams here to bring “Solving the whole problem” here
- LV: Now I get it — this is what I needed to see to understand the relation of

** RSP: Reproducible research                                          :25m:
- Ray screensharing: “Ten Simple Rules for Reproducible Computational Research”
  - This paper is from “PLOS Computational Biology”
- Reproducibility is a basic criterion of science
- Now in bio (especially) we have the computer processing the data
- There’s been a debate about what’s the best way to do this
- In the Hypernotebook channel Ray’s dropped in 5 papers from this discussion
- Now walking through one of the papers
- This is something that a lot of the projects from Emacs could contribute to
- Useful for biologists?  And useful for thinking about the potenital power of Emacs!
*** 01 For every result keep track of how it was produced
- E.g., involved a certain computation
- I measured these pistils... so provide the data
*** 02 Avoid manual data manipulation steps
- Don’t just do the conversion on the back on an envelope
- If the data change, you can redo
- It’s clear what the steps were
- If you can’t avoid doing it manually, then note what files were changed etc.
*** 03 Archive the exact version of all EXTERNAL programs used
*** 04 Version control for all CUSTOM scripts
- LV: it’s like fight club
*** 05 Record all INTERMEDIATE results, where possible in standardised formats
- RSP: Emacs + Hypernotebooks could shine here
- People shouldn’t have to wait until they get to the final step to see if they disagree
- LV: So far, a lot of this was handled with Git (e.g., minimal commits should allow you to recompile)
  - Archiving the material
  - Record all intermediate states
  - Git allows you to save things in the reflog
  - This is a testament to why reproducible research is linked with version control
- RSP: There’s another article on “Git for reproducible research”
*** 06 If you’re going to have a random thing, include your random seed
- LV: I’m parsing this as testing (tests for software) — in the tests you’ll account for the randomness
- This makes sense, for extracting not just a specific rule but the rationale that can be applied more broadly
*** 07 Always store the raw data behind your plot
- Esp. in biology as they have lots of plots
*** 08 [#A] Generate hierarchical analysis output allowing layers of increasing detail to be inspected
- LV: More reminiscent of DARCS - computing relationships in ‘geometric history’
  - [[http://darcs.net/][Darcs - FrontPage]]
  - [[https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qkVJ-L5MqE4/VyN4T0baemI/AAAAAAAAC3k/Uh5BiWMY6ucPeARdd2hWlxozj1omIuYugCLcB/s1600/deps.png][deps.png (PNG Image, 805 × 656 pixels)]]
- Suppose someone measured the pistils, in different families, and then in a paper summarising them in different taxa
- If I want to go from different hierarchy into different statements about how plants evolved
- “We find hypertext to be particularly relevant here.”
- “You should inspect the details under the summaries.”
- Similar to the diagrams that show the detail underlying each blob.
- JC: This seems a bit Arxana-like
*** 09 Connect textual statements to underlying results
- With most authors: we wish you luck finding the actual data or computation in the supporting material
- This is where things like Emacs can really shine
- You could use something more like a Zettlekasten: some of the cards may have computations on them
- If you say “instead of just writing your paper from scratch, you /compose/ it in a way where you leave your links it.”
  - So: a computation, I go to some computer algebra or proof assistant, or whatever
- LV: If you’re using minimal commits, when you insert a commit message, you explicitly tag this commit as building this feature — so you could link the comments into the codebase
- RSP: Usually the text of the paper and the analysis live in different places (Jupyter + ShareLaTeX)... they may be sitting on the same screen but it’s the human cutting and pasting between them
  - So, two years later, if all you’ve given me is the paper and the archived code, the cutting-and-pasting link is lost 
- JC: This reminds me of what I said about creative writing on the Org Roam Discourse 
*** 10 Provide public access to scripts, runs, results
- The obvious one for open source
*** BONUS: The horror story
- Just to show how we have been abusing ShareLaTeX
- Action items inside of ShareLaTeX
- JC: Cf. =ed= package
*** Next steps
- RSP: I’ll put them in Org Roam (shock and awe tactic)
  - When we publish the thing in a month or two, we’ll have some kind of Org file
- LV: Be careful about v2 release timing! Please make sure to stick to v1 so it is reliable
- So, we’ll submit a paper, with supplementary material — and then maybe have another paper about ‘use of Emacs’ with this as a case study
- Plan would be to have a preprint alongside the talk
- Would be nice if we then had the design document for Org Roam open
- We can start to operationalise these things
** Break                                                                :7m:
- Cultural reflection on data collection in France, e.g., domains tracking what we do
- Cards linking... 50% of pharmacies do track anonymised data (though it’s easy to compute what you’re doing)
- But the software doesn’t allow them to /not/ forward the info
** LV: org-roam: micro-talk                                             :3m:
- The only thing I have to talk about is that I am writing a design document
- Planning v2 changes: this isn’t being done innocently
- I want to rekindle the Org Roam crowd-funding campaign and this would be the anchor
- Some of the features we discussed with Arxana could make their way into the long-term project
- So, a lot of the stuff we’ve been discussing over the past weeks, with /direction/, /milestones/, and other crowd-pleasers
- Leo and Jethro will be making time for this — and planning-wise the goal is to get money and sustainment
- So, timing for directing people to Org Roam at a time when the ‘crowdfunding’ (messages, Reddit, justify spending time on this)
- If we’re somewhat in harmony, there’d be a visibility benefit (esp. academic and corporate interests)
*** For now
- Cameron, Ximo: this is sort of in-house
- It’s publicly released, advocating the tools
- And there are many avenues for PR
- The summer will feature a lot of visibility, starting in mid-July
- Maybe these things can be discussed next week

* PAR                                                                   :15m:

*** 1. Review the intention: what do we expect to learn or make together?
**** We all know what each other is doing, this will help us to coordinate our efforts
**** Three topics in the agenda (Arxana, Reproducibile Research, and Org Roam updates)
*** 2. Establish what is happening: what and how are we learning?
**** Our three topics today seem related
**** With regards to org-roam: it probably has a lot potential, especially considering RoamResearch’s successful funding
*** 3. What are some different perspectives on what’s happening?
**** We didn’t get Noorah’s perspective which might have led us, had she been here, into thinking more about adaptive capacity
**** Joe has brought some inspiration from Futures study... Joe is feeling itchy to do some Futures stuff
**** LV: Don’t essentialise Noorah as the adaptive capacity expert!
**** Ray appreciated Leo’s perspective on the reproducible research
**** LV: Also, this meeting has lost 50% of its population
*** 4. What did we learn or change?
**** Reinjecting different voices is necessary to keep growing
**** Ideal scenario for Leo is to contact people via the Shock and Awe tactic and have them say ‘we would love to have you in 2 weeks’ and we are then ready
*** 5. What else should we change going forward?
**** As a fix to our potential isolation in a group that agrees most of the time, this points us towards opening up the meeting to discuss with other people
**** We had discussed having a monthly session that we wanted to discuss in public
**** If we can’t resolve the lack of different perspectives by having different people, either we recruit people, or have a monthly open meeting that allows us to recruit people
**** This sort of outreach could happen within EmacsNYC?
**** LV: We’re able to commit discussing, but we’d like to remobilise others — though we’re doing work anyway
**** If we were to contact them in mid-June for a 1st week of July panel... that’s too soon
**** User research chat

* TODO Make a long-range calendar for ERG
| Jul 2021 | Possibly going public |
| Sep 2021 | Panel Emacs NYC       |

* Suggestions for next agenda
- Going public
- What to do when LV is gone

* Check-out (exceptional or not)                                         :5m:

** JC
- Continuing to be tired; but this has still been fun
** RSP
- This has been a good meeting look forward to carrying these things forward.
** LV
- Glad to hav grokked Arxana; unhappy that we finished one minute late.
