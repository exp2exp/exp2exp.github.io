** Where are we at?

- JC: I feel like I need to *consolidate* what I have.  What have I been doing most of my life, what have I been consolidating towards?
- JC: Could we use org-roam to provide support for creative writing?
  - Would allow me to conciliate different interests in my life.
- JC: org-roam could be useful for many-many things!

** What Qomon can do

- They can turn the data you provide into data that is visualisable.
- They can merge tables so that you can merge and compare other pieces of data
- It’s similar to merging graphs,

** Careers

- E.g, communication at IPPR
- E.g., English didn’t stop Leo from getting into Software Engineering
- How to present a rounded profile in a way that makes it interesting?
  - NA: job skills, like ‘analyse’, ‘produce’, etc.

** Honest account followed by buzzword rewrite
- "Tech lead", "stacks", "dev ops", etc.
- Do I want an AI skill set?
- Instead focus on what I’ve been doing in the last 5 years

** What has Joe been up to recently?

** Where to find ... people who care?

- Leftist groups?
- Working for NGOs
- Nonprofits and foundations
- Work is to pay bills
- Look for people who are exciting
- /Mutatis mutandis/ of Brookes with finance, but without any aspirations, might create more room for dreaming: *compartmentalization*
- Development work would have 0 impact on work at Brookes, but I could surf on another wave of experience?

*** 1. Establish what is happening: what and how are we learning?
- It’s been a very free form chat
- Taking stock, thinking about where things are at...

*** 2. What are some different perspectives on what's happening?
- JC: I liked the reframe of thinking about _who_ I want to work with
- I appreciate the support

*** 3. What did we learn or change?
- Noorah’s birthday is May 17th and she’s looking forward to an ultrasound
- LV: I had a great time doing Rust, but I don’t want to burn myself out

*** 4. What else should we change going forward?
- Meet on 20th, not on 27th or 3rd of June!
- University of Finland provides a "Fullstack Open" class on Javascript, Typescript, and React: how to design a website from scratch.
  - Good for people with some programming experience, to get up to speed.
  - NA: I’d like build my data analysis profile w/ some interactive data science things
    - LV: Try this: [[https://fullstackopen.com/en/][Full stack open]]
  - Joe to pitch the idea of having some interactive site to Alex (Shiny? Tableau?)
  - Joe to ask Madeleine whether Tableau can be scripted with R?
- Think about who I like to work with and why!

* Tentative agenda for next week
- Leo can make it next week but not in three weeks

* Check-out
