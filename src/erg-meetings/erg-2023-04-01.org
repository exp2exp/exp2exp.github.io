** NA
- Business as usual!

** JC
- Little bummed about difficult conversations right prior tot he meeting.
- Has been investigating follow-ups to the work with AT.
- https://hyperreal.enterprises/bristol/

** LV
- Lots of work stuff.

* Meta points

** TODO Don't forget to record the session!                             :LV:

** TODO Pre-PAR ‚Äî Review the intention: what do we expect to learn or make together?

** We did run a workshop with Baruch CUNY CIS 9590 students
- Joe, Ray, and Charlie were guest lecturers and we used ideas from our workshop.
- ‚ÄòData Fairs‚Äô was cool and we are now doing something a little related in the Peeragogy project (3% finished).

#+begin_quote
I would never have been able to get data visualisations of my work
without this project; now I have them, I can use them for future
funding applications and demonstrate the implications of data-led
historical study‚Äù
#+end_quote

- https://datafairs.github.io/submit.html - was cool

** We will offer you a short training in data processing and pair you up w/ someone with a real problem + offer mentoring

** Innovate UK as a possible opportunity
*** ¬£50K between 2 companies
- What would we want to be doing...?
- What is the problem...
- What we do:
  - "WE FACILITATE THE SCOPING/CONCEPTUALISATION STAGE"

- Can AI help with the conceptualisation?  E.g., equip the company w/ good companies w/ good concepts.
  - If so, could another organisation like [[http://www.nactem.ac.uk/index.php][NaCTeM]] help us build this?

- We do /computer-aided/ stuff, it could bring in any old NLP, using functions that parse a set of data, mining it.
- E.g., [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation][LDA]]

*** What‚Äôs "AI" in this case?
- Text mining (probably) isn‚Äôt.
- It‚Äôs not just GPT either

**** But, AI is in a peak hype phase right now
- So, it would be better to train ourselves to use NLP, apply it to our own models, do it with good engineering practices
- Rather than just relying on a model (like ChatGPT, which is only for /reflowing content/ & context that already exists; whereas we‚Äôre orienting ourselves to problems that don‚Äôt have existing solutions)
- When you try to go outside of the playbook, ChatGPT will be bad at it
- It‚Äôs even bad at "find me places to visit nearby"

- 1000 monkeys more reliable than 1000 ChatGPTs

- If we understand what it takes to make our own model, /we‚Äôd be able to train it to make it innovative/
  - ‚ÄúComputer-aided disruption‚Äù

- However this is a fairly academic path that‚Äôs difficult to invest into

** Review our web page & mission vision statement

Current websites:
- [[https://exp2exp.github.io/]] (404ing currenty, used to be our published notes)
  - Maybe we could host an orui of our hyperreal notes?
    - CICD on note-push?
- [[https://hyperreal.enterprises/][https://hyperreal.enterprises/ - Hyperreal Enterprises]]
- [[https://hyperreal.enterprises/bristol/][https://hyperreal.enterprises/bristol/ - ORUI - Bristol slip-box]]

** Maybe it‚Äôs more of a personal goal to remain more focused

*** 1. Establish what is happening: what and how are we learning?

- Reflective day summing up a bunch of ‚Äòoutside‚Äô perspectives from Joe on directions for the company
- Also talked a bit about our web page

*** 2. What are some different perspectives on what's happening?

- We had all ‚Äòwanted to do more‚Äô at one time

*** 3. What did we learn or change?

- We‚Äôve gotten enough feedback to learn

*** 4. What else should we change going forward?

- If we want to head down a route of training models, we could get access to GPU arrays, using about $10/month

* Tentative agenda for next week

- LV is not available next week

* Check-out
