** LV
- Having come from many interviews, he’s passed interviews, and is near to clinching something with Qomon
- The prospects are looking very good


* Meta points

** TODO Don't forget to record the session!                             :LV:

** TODO Pre-PAR — Review the intention: what do we expect to learn or make together?

* Agenda (Part 1) - "Why?"
:PROPERTIES:
:Effort:   0:20
:END:

- Why do we do this?
- Is anyone going to use the work we did?
- The project is still up to us!

- I’ll run a workshop w/ Brookes to help develop their strategy about Open Research
- What does it mean for ‘research to be open’?
- It means everyone can get access, but will they also have the ability to reproduce/understand?

** But, it’s not 100% clear that employee skills are valued, despite Brookes being a HE and research place...?

- It’s meant to be a self-sustaining system
- But if it’s heavily encroached by capitalism, you limit access and # of educators
- Brookes is at an interface between traditional education and avant garde technology
- How could they let you in but not realise the potential?
- At Amazon, they’ve invested in creating a collective skill set
- What about here?  It’s more of a gas pump mentality, despite it being a research enterprise...

** LV: Life + work
- Sometimes I felt I was taking holiday, sometimes I just wasn’t working
- But mostly it was about finding what kind of day I want to have
- Parents: He must be lonely, he has all this potential he’s not using...
  - Yes, I might have had less strife had I been employed, but actually I was making good progress
  - And I’m ready to plop the job into my life

** NA: This made me think...
Leo’s journey over the last few years, we & your folks may have been projecting what we thought your life should be like.
But you were trusting your gut!

- JC: If you’re not too miserable, then parents shouldn’t be too concerned.
- LV: But what if you’re not clear yourself, e.g., because you’re too in tune with your parents’ concern!
  - For me stopping teaching was jarring for the parents & others
  - JC: It’s ok for the parents to be concerned but not to organise your life around it

** JC: The positives & negatives
- Was it a good balance?
  - At least here, work w/ Noorah & Leo has felt balanced!
- LV: "Why" question might be answered with "We want to be at the /forefront of ethical AI research/."
  - But what if they don’t also do upskilling?  How does this align w/ the actual mission?  It forces you to confront anything vapourish.  "I show up to work because I’m contributing to /X/."
  - Otherwise it’s just an ailimentary job.
  - Here, we do find a sense of purpose; if we do light creative work & achieve moderate financial success but from social perspectives it’s been unfailing.

* BREAK — none this time

* Agenda (Part 2) — Month by month look ahead
:PROPERTIES:
:Effort:   0:20
:END:

** Org Roam feature requests
- Arrowheads
- Typed links?
- Real-time updates

** Next few months outlook
- Probably fine to spend a couple hours a day on OR;
  - JC: But you might prefer to be spending the time on Rust...?
  - LV: I’ll have a 35 minute train to spend some time on reading/preparing
  - Org Mode parser in Rust might be a good route

* PAR
:PROPERTIES:
:Effort:   0:10
:END:

*** 1. Establish what is happening: what and how are we learning?
- Review of our current feelings, calendars, outlooks on life
*** 2. What are some different perspectives on what's happening?
- Review of our cultures of experimentation
- E.g., actually I’d like responsibility, helping other people, &c.
- ‘Productivity’ isn’t purely an individual thing, it’s about the group
*** 3. What did we learn or change?
- Becoming more aware of the transition points
  - E.g., confidence level & indicators thereof
  - Maybe there’s a gut feeling to do more development work, or business work &c. (e.g., entrepreneur meetups in Oxford or London)
*** 4. What else should we change going forward?
- JC: I want to try and do Noorah’s suggested exercise about an ideal day/week
- Revisit the Abby stuff, we did get a ping from her?  This would address confidence!

* Tentative agenda for next week
