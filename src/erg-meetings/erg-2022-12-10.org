* 10 December 2022  ‚Äî Emacs Research Group


* Check-ins
:PROPERTIES:

:END:

** NA
- Potential new cat owner üêà
- Cat has been visiting for 10 days to 2 weeks, Annan's been taking care of it
- Now wants to come inside :-)
- Petsmart bound

** LV
- Just came from a tangential conversation that was tense; I had to tell my friend that I'm giving up (the 3rd time)
  - NA: Keep in mind that you'd be foregoing ‚Ç¨40-80K per year and the quick route to senior dev + management in your case!
  - And you can always go back to do the PhD later
- It's freezing (current cast-iron-paned heater isn't on yet)
- Low on money so doesn't want to gamble on the bill!
- Emacsconf was great
- Following that, lots of frustration leading to applying for 5 developer positions
  - LV: Now's the time for rejoicing in my readiness for this approach
  - Besides I've been fighting impostership for a long time and value the self-made aspect of my development; I'd rather take the long way round
  - NA: So you want to focus more on development now... rather than writing and philosophy; but they'd shape your focus for 2 years
  - A programme in an information school would work better for you
  - Which would you rather be getting more training on?
  - LV: So, where's the ceiling on what I can do on my own?
  - Self-learning can be very inefficient
  - JC: You don't need to do it now!
  - If you went to an iSchool you could leave w/ a Masters in Information Studies ‚Äî much more employable
- I also just want to spend time here in France & to be more grounded!

** JC
- In Minneapolis, reconnecting w/ Anders

* Meta points

** TODO Don't forget to record the session!                             :LV:

** TODO Pre-PAR ‚Äî Review the intention: what do we expect to learn or make together?
- Catch Leo up on the workshop framing from NA + JC

* Agenda (Part 1)
:PROPERTIES:
:Effort:   0:20
:END:

- We can't measure the strength of connection between nodes in Org Roam!
- Nor anything like that in Org Roam UI
- It could be something simple like /frequency of words/ to test the strength of connection: which would only be applied to neighbouring nodes
- Read into network analysis, they have done stuff like this before
  - Quadratic (e.g., 100x100) at worst case
  - But this does go to linguistic ideas
  - We can think more about how to do this well

- If you have many lines going out of it you could at least say "This one is instrumental to others"
- This is a constant time!

- Tech question: if I open org-roam.db w/ DB Browser for SQLite
  - There are 2 columns w/ node id an alias...
  - Can we pull the text for the node id into another column
  - Text data is currently stored in file, but it would be easier for analysis if we had the full-text data inside
  - LV: Though, from data-hygiene standpoint, it's considered better to keep only metadata in the database! ‚Äî Otherwise computation vs database writes is tricky
  - Maybe I need a python script that extracts the text from each node & puts it into compute
- "Datalake" might be a tech thing we could use

- Expanding the local neighbourhood of new nodes could be useful for thinking about "what's missing" that would make our new insights more effective & more valuable

- Think about this in terms of "activation" ‚Äî you might be more likely to create more links in an already-densely-connected area

- Another route: exclude distance 2, but see connections that aren't obvious (not distance 3 but w/ high salience)
- E.g., also, "retract nodes that are already well connected, so that we only see the new stuff"

- Currently there's no way to do these queries or interact with the graph

* Agenda (Part 2)
:PROPERTIES:
:Effort:   0:20
:END:

** Speed through of specific changes
- Use Bristol Pound to build similar network of exchange which we can analyse
- Rethink the CLA along bio-psycho-social-eco
- Potentially create new patterns with pictures created by participants

** Web form demo
- Populate name, text
- Google is handling the backend here
- JC: Maybe also node that they are connecting to
  - NA: But I want to make it as simple as possible at first, e.g., "I am reacting to something someone else is saying"
  - LV: Like on "Survivor" breakout rooms
  - JC: OK, this is like the open string, and we could build other features on them
- Timestamps could differentiate the phases
- Could also display as a timeline, and we come back and interact with them later
- LV: How about creating documents of the design ideas... so that feature-wise we have ideas fitted under bigger ideas; simple ideas are easy to keep in mind, but more complex ideas are hard to remember
- JC: Can we zoom in on the ideas that are related to technology in our Org Roam?

- Can it be phone friendly?
- LV: E.g., React/reactive display should help with this

*** 1. Establish what is happening: what and how are we learning?
- Brief meeting today
- Deployed some computing concepts in today's meeting

*** 2. What are some different perspectives on what's happening?
- Leo feeling unfocused (and slept 12 hours last night!); will be fine when the quagmire is resolved
- JC: You do seem to be in a transition phase of some kind
- Enjoyed demos inducing conversations (e.g., you can actually expand Org Roam ‚Äî cool!)
- This helps think about things we can do

*** 3. What did we learn or change?
- JC: Spelling of Annan
- Leo has insta-mime ability with is push-to-mute

*** 4. What else should we change going forward?
- JC: I met a couple people that I might want to suggest
- Next Saturday Noorah is traveling to Kuwait (GMT+3)

* Tentative agenda for next week

- Abby mentioned earlier in the week
- After that, next meet as ERG on 7th?
- Can find times during the week to coordinate as needed

* Check-out

** NA
- Excited about the cat
- Packing soon!

** JC
- Shortly going to see my second cousin
- I do have a slight cold so won't cough on her
- Oh yeah, lots of meetings for next week
  - NA: me too, got dragged in!

** LV
- JC: Drop it for a year, you'll have everything and more next year!
- LV: I have people around me who know I prevaricate when I'm at 90%...
