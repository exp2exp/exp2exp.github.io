* 15 April 2023  — Emacs Research Group

* Check-ins
:PROPERTIES:
:Effort:   0:15
:END:

** NA
 - Going back to swimming using the University's gym

** JC
- Has a cold

** LV
- Has upgraded his bike with a carrying system
- Show-and-tell: bike bag carrier

* Meta points

** TODO Don't forget to record the session!                             :LV:
** TODO Pre-PAR — Review the intention: what do we expect to learn or make together?
- Keep it short.

- We’ve been meeting fortnightly for a while, what are we expecting to achieve with this in the in the short/medium term (couple months)?
  - More clients?
  - Job security?
  - Chill sessions talking about Emacs?

- Meanwhile Leo has a HR+Business interviews completed at several companies
- May have less time to invest into big projects
- How are our professional lives evolving

- Admin request: Paying Noorah from the Abby contract, should be ≈1/3 of the money in there
- Insurance will kick in $2K out of the $5K

* Agenda (Part 1) - How has it been going?
:PROPERTIES:
:Effort:   0:20
:END:

** JC: Trying to find the next thing
- AI Teamup opportunity: Interesting
- Climate Adaptive Behavior Change (ABC): Enhancing Resilience Within and Across Communities - Climate ABC
- Re: 4 circles; before and after; line down the middle; could revise to 3 states: too much, too little, in balance; related to donut economics; it’d be nice to have fluidity in-between the 3 sectors.
  - ‘Progression towards centre’ was the original dynamic; could revise the above states as different link types.
** NA: We’re kind of recovering from some post-workshop burn out
- Taking it slow would be a good thing
- Professionally, I’ve been thinking about activist business investing in tech and/or changing jobs
  - You need money to make money
- Has been in current job for 1 year (less 3 days)
** LV: For me it feel more like completion of project w/o anything lined up
- If we’d had continuance w/ Abby, Judith, Florian we’d likely have been meeting since
- It’s not so much that we over-worked; we knew we’d need to work more than we were being paid for
- This is cause for resting rather than over-analysing how we burned out
- In my case I moved on quickly to job interviews, ≈1 month later was doing the interviews
- Now I have 4 technical interviews, all in Paris, paying 55K-60K€/annum (e.g. 3K after tax, vs French median of 1900€/month, good especially for a single person)
  - Some unpronounceable company-names, might request a gratuity in this regard
- Qmomn — *a platform for political orgs & NGOs to organise themselves*, backend in Golang
  - CTO may not have time to do a full technical interview
  - Working w/ Canadian election, African countries &c. w/ data on 40m people
  - Would learn infra w/o being alone
- ‘Operations’ vs ‘Development’ — meetings w/ all 4 orgs next week, so should have more to say about employment circa 14 days
*** Stability: 
- Wanted to have everything going vis à vis my schedule, plus a job to get freedom from money worries
- Could also mean the ability not to require payment for work we do, whereas before I couldn’t justify doing this stuff w/o getting paid b/c otherwise I owuld be practicing
  - So I could put in some /pro bono/ work around here
- Also I have an offer in Brittany

* Agenda (Part 2) - How would we like it to be going?
:PROPERTIES:
:Effort:   0:20
:END:

** JC:
- If I don’t find my job very fulfilling, it’s fine as long as I can find ways to reinvent myself in the process
- Current job is a little more taking than it was last year, but it’s still a possibility.
- Two other forays
  - Master in Creative Writing 
  - Applied Topos Institute summer job;
  - (Didn’t get into either of these.)
- I would like to find clarity on this purpose soon.
- Am thinking some about company business stuff (10% or so)

** NA: 
- Me & Anan talk about this as wouldn’t it be great to be able to retire and focus on pilates
  - JC: Sacha quasi-retired a few years ago, after working at IBM for a while, and has some family support & responsibilities
- When we talked about the method, we want to apply it in different contexts!
  - E.g., education, business, open research...
  - Might be some budget for the ‘online team’ — we can do live display of the nodes being added on the screen

** LV: 
- Hyperreal isn’t yet ready to be profitable (unless we don’t pay ourselves)
- What would we expect from reaching out to Abby again, e.g., if she had more work?
  - The conditions have slightly changed
- NA: When Leo gets his job, I’d give him the space, at least 3 to 4 months to get ramped up w/ onboarding in the job
  - LV: This will be my first work outside of academia, w/ the goal of a position of stability, e.g., where I can learn Rust, work on Org Roam &c., w/o needing to think about sustaining myself
  - Though it might be too much to be on edge and also sacrifice the Saturday to para-professional stuff
- 14 days rhythm supports a fortnightly tutoring session on Org Roam, but it would be good to go back to something weekly
  - What about 2 weeks on, 1 week off?  After the *12th of May* could be good.

** ChatGPT:
- LV: I ask it for contextual stuff
- NA: I made it create a vacation itinerary!
- GPT4.5 should be coming out in the Fall!

* PAR                                                                   
:PROPERTIES:
:Effort:   0:10
:END:

*** 1. Establish what is happening: what and how are we learning?
- Now back after another couple weeks off

*** 2. What are some different perspectives on what's happening?
- We have doubled down on mutual sympathy w/o any particular deliverables

*** 3. What did we learn or change?
- Big proposal of 2 weeks on + 1 off to try in a month
- Leo will need an adjustment period for onboarding w/ work of about 3 months 

*** 4. What else should we change going forward?
- Pay Noorah
- Do we need any money left to pay monthly fees? 
- Joe to do some playtesting w/ game group w/in the next month 

* Tentative agenda for next weekS

** Calender with new rhythm
