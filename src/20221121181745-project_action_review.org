#+filetags: :WS:

* Summary

*Context* Work in progress. *If* we are working on something together
BUT we might lose momentum; *Then* use a review template to think about
our progress. Questions like the following can be asked at any point in
a project, and provide a momentary record of perspectives which can be
analysed later.

1. /Review the intention: what do we (did we) expect to learn or make
   together?/

2. /Establish what is happening: what and how are we learning?/

3. /What are some different perspectives on what's happening?/

4. /What did we learn or change?/

5. /What else should we change going forward?/
