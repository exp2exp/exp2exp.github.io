#+title: Dimension analysis

* Instructions

Coming back together with the full group, arrange the maps you created
across a set of dimensions.  Two dimensions would be traditional:
creating a 2-by-2 grid with ``best'' in the upper right, ``worst'' in
the lower left, and so on â€” but feel free to use as many dimensions as
you wish.  For example, it could be helpful to use the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Basic_Human_Values][Theory of Basic
Human Values]] to organise the scenarios.
