* 27 March 2021 — Emacs Research Group

* Check-ins                                                             :20m:

:END:
** Noorah
- [[https://ohmyveggies.com/recipe-broccoli-parmesan-meatballs/][Broccoli meatballs!]] (but taste more like falafel)
- Had a tryst with R-studio (how dare she?)
- Didn’t do much with Emacs other than writing
- R Studio good for creating websites and exporting to Word (useful for Noorah’s students who use the Word ecosystem)
- How to port back ‘track changes’ into Markdown? pandoc doesn’t do this
- Critic Markup is easier to apply
** Joe
- Leo helped Org mode setup and I want to demo briefly
- Alex in #alex-msc channel, might join here to give new user perspective sometime
** Raymond
- Discussion of open source
- Depending on the context, OSS is important but so is open source, schematics, standards
- OSS makes sense at the level at which you’re coding (then you also need access to interact with the system!)
- Unfair competition / unfair to lock people out
- Maybe obstacles to entry are similar
- Has been interested in 2x 2hr sessions on technical and social sessions...
** Leo
- Finished an EmacsConf session, now using
- Very tired, but happy this morning due to some online shopping, and glad to talk with Emacs Conf team about RMS stuff
- Basically at capacity for this
- Has someone paying him for tutoring on Emacs, this will bridge to the kickstarter and point in the direction he wants to go
- Helps envision a level of funding for Kickstarter that can provid tutoring (with markup, e.g., €2K for 10 hours of coaching)
- ‘User support’ could be another part? — Less systematic but still useful? w/o structured path
- Internal deadline 5th of April?


* Things to keep in mind
** Record the sodding session

* Agenda
** JC: Alex’s induction into Emacs and other demo stuff                :20m:
- JC is excited because he finally got around to refactoring his configuration as a literal config in org-mode
- RStudio + Word comparison with Emacs
- Alex might be a good person to be discussing R-Studio with
- Interoperability and ability to translate... E.g. between /R Markdown/ and /Org Mode/ — ways to go but it would be cool!
- R Markdown has slightly different code chunk
- Understanding what to do with DONE tasks when they are done... I don’t have this yet — use ‘date tree’? Or...?
- Thanks for the peer support around Org Mode!
 - RSP: my use has been buried inside Logseq
 - How could we extend Logseq? — Who uses this and what are the priorities?
 - "Like a wiki on the web but with limited $\LaTeX$"

** LV: Coming up with a calendar of people to invite                    :15m:
*** List of potential guests                                         :list:
**** Alex (HyperReal)
**** Mark Dawson (M-x Research, again)
- Interested in improving M-x Research
**** Qiantan (CRDT, again)
**** John Kitchin (Kitchin group)
**** OGM folks: Jerry and/or Pete (design c/o The Brain poweruser perspective)
**** Logseq folks
**** Tyler (Firn)
**** Charlie (peeragogy, again)
**** Deb Nicholson (OSI)
**** Adam Porter (alphapapa)
**** Wendy Ross / Samantha Copeland (Serendipity)
***** They’re interested in how research happens in a humanistic approach
***** ‘How research happens’ could be a glue for other groups
**** Brian Darcus (CSL, i.e. Citation Syntax Language; present on the org-roam discourse)
**** Cameron Ray Smith on bibliography stuff (plus maybe Logseq user experience?)
*** What about making some things public?
**** ‘Series 2’ becoming public sometime?
- Following a session to debrief
- If we wanted to livestream that’s another level: this could bring us to a wider group
- Maybe a lower-key thing like fielding the video, and have a ‘launch’ after a while
- Easiest is just recording the session and releasing it
- /Producer/ in EmacsConf team could help, also good to have good streaming platform
- Could do less or more often
- None of us wants to do video editing, but it would make it awesome (see ML Street Talk for production values!)
*** Calendar

** LV: Org-mode tutoring                                                :5m:
- Context: Sacha got Leo in touch w/ someone who initially wanted 6 hours but now it’s weekly
- He’s ex-Apple, currently working in security sector, interested in automation
- Consultant side being mobilised
- Next week he’s taking a break
- 5 hrs/wk, €100/hr
- On board with both tutoring and development (+ merging) of functionality
- Endorsement for the Kickstarter coming along
- Possibly more people coming along
- It’s not too far from some business models we discussed w/ Hyperreal last year (though this is clearly a bit of a windfall)
- Luck & jumping on the opportunity simultaneously? (metal detector metaphor)

*** JC: An interesting ‘persona’
- [[https://www.brafton.co.uk/blog/strategy/persona-examples-from-around-the-web-and-why-they-work/][Example]]

** NA: Work with R-studio                                              :10m:
- Chapter developing on a Github organisation
- Documents split into sections
- Each Rmd file is a section, each with a separate angle
- Uses Bookdown
- If you go to =index.Rmd= it knits the sections all into one
- There’s an MS Windows template, everything nicely goes in
- Chicago style references
- Zotero has the bib items in it
- Noorah has a BetterBibtex plugin
- Inside of R Markdown, you can put in a CSL file
 - LV: The developer of CSL is an Org Roam user
 - RSP: Cameron is now (after some time with Mendeley) trying out PaperPile
 - Dropbox makes sense here
- JC: Would be nice to get some citations into our shared work 
- With Zotero: uncheck ‘file syncing’ so you don’t have to pay them
- Bibtex keys show up as =[@CITATIONKEY]= — they show up in footnotes; if you used author/year you can have citep 
- Specify bibliography in the YAML
- You can also suppress the bibliography with another key
- There’s an ‘insert citations’ GUI tool inside R Markdown
- Track Changes export / intercompatibility remains a challenge
- Editing DOCX in Emacs isn’t currently possible

*** Leo: we can do the same in Emacs
- We need to get design documents on this experience
- You’ve shown completion, but we do this with Helm Bibtex
- If the problem now is the window and the layout... that’s 30 minutes!
- If we have people doing research in nat sci and soc sci, then we’re building something that people in the real world are using
- NA: If you’re dealing with 8K citations, are you organising them by themes? Sections? Mendeley themes...
- “Md Roam” already exists; would be a small jump to support R Markdown mode; get in touch with Nobiot (org-roam Discourse)
- Once people are comfortable maybe we could bridge to Org Mode


*** BTW Also some related Emacs packages
#+begin_src
  zotelo 20160602.949   available    melpa    Manage Zotero collections from emacs
  zotxt  20210222.347   available    melpa    Tools to integrate emacs with Zotero via the zotxt plugin.

** JC: Grant WIP                                                        :15m:
- Quick report
- person days vs working days
- Next hurdle is soon
- Subsequent panel in July

* PAR                                                                   :15m:

:END:
*** 1. Review the intention: what do we expect to learn or make together?
**** Come back together after a couple weeks out; catchup
*** 2. Establish what is happening: what and how are we learning?
**** Longer check in this time
**** We’ll have Ray on this time!
**** It evolved organically in a more unstructured session
*** 3. What are some different perspectives on what’s happening?
**** It was nice to catch up
**** Emacs gauntlet has been thrown down! The R Markdown affair may come to an end...?
**** RSP: Both Noorah and I have been bringing in experiences of how this relates to research with other collaborators (incl. their use of other platforms)
**** NA: Continuing on the goal of ‘how to do collaborative research’ — e.g. switching formats to minimise information loss, incorporating comments on Word and incorporating them
**** RSP: This is also the case in Peeragogy (using Overleaf w/ minimal pushback)
**** There can be very different expectations about how collaborations go
**** Let’s treasure these things for the CLA
*** 4. What did we learn or change?
**** A lot of interesting topics came up that we didn’t know about at the beginning
**** Got in some planning for more structured sessions with guests
*** 5. What else should we change going forward?
**** CLA for next week, breaking down text into doable tasks?
**** Leo can demo commands for splitting tasks, GTD style!
**** Try to keep things to 1h30m in future?
**** Maybe useful to look at Lisa’s interview to think about structured data gathering method

* Check-out (exceptional or not)

** RSP
- Found this quite useful, pleasantly happy about the different topics that came in relating different topics, e.g., relating to ongoing work with bibliography
** JC
- Hungry again.
- Reserved the new house, so, from April 1, probably wont’ be too available
- Lot of change going on.
- Always happy with those meetings.
** NA
- Off for lunch next!
- Great seeing you guys, interested in Joe’s Org Agenda for future 
** LV
- GC problems IRL
- But did clean up his email inbox!
