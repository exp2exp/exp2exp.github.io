* Instructions

** Introductions
- Bristol Pilot: Abby presented a 10 minute slide show about the "Public Space and Public Health"
** Meet and greet with participants
- Bristol Pilot: minimal, people said hi
** TODO ice-breaker activity
- /Could be based on an in-advance ask, like, email a photo?/
- Maybe better to have it be something that can happen at a coffee break.
** TODO Go over the general rules and norms
- Bristol Pilot: Joe presented an outline of what was going on on the day
** Make sure we have a clear terminology/taxonomy per phase, not only for patterns and roles but the mundane terms that we use
** Explain theme of the workshop
- NB. different people/groups might go in different directions from this point.
** Explain the process
- "Discuss the theme, discuss the scenarios for development, zoom in on those, flesh them out."
- "Find new ‘design patterns’ that enable them to solve new problem."
*** Explain CLA (also good for us as well) *and/or* present the framework with some tangible interactives, like cards, so they don’t get bored
- We can explain how this will be applied, e.g., via an *example*
- Diagrams can convey information quickly (e.g., iceberg)
- Roles & patterns are visual and memorable
- How will it be used in this phase: decent to the myth
- Be able to access the rules quickly (cf. "Settlers of Catan")
