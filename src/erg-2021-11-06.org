* 6 November 2021 — Emacs Research Group

* Check-ins                                                              :5m:
** Joe
- Big step-forward in the personal relationship realm
- Cultivating the present
** Ray
- Has added Emacs-related biography for notes
- Looking forward to latter part of next week to start planning the next phase
** Leo
- Following up from yesterday, had a good day today, went to bed early yesterday; would have finished the film at 9:30 but turned off at 9:00.  Fell asleep in 2 minutes and slept 10 hours.  Upon waking up, started on Python and algorithms for the first time in a week.  Fits with "ensuring progress rather than adherence to the schedule".
  - Sleep important as a way to deal with the effect of stress
  - LV: needs to be highly stressed to lose sleep over it
- Also got ORB working with Org Roam v2
- All in all a good day, probably the most productive day in a while

* Meta points
** DONE Don’t forget to record the session!                             :LV:
CLOSED: [2021-11-06 Sat 18:39]

** Speaker notes feature for org-tree-slides would be easy to add
- We don’t have the capacity to do in real-time on this call but it would probably only take an hour or so to add them in the future.
- For now we can just get on with what we have

* Agenda                                                                :35m:
** EmacsConf: Finish preparing the notes                               :35m:

* Tentative agenda for next week (only 1h)
- Recording this talk on 9th
- Organising around PLoP on 11th?
- Other planning activities to be done next week as well

* Check-out                                                             :5m:
** RP
- Will the notes be in the repo?
 - LV: Yes 
- Hope to read them in the next 2-3 days
** LV
- Links to current content being added to ERG channel
** JC
- Let’s not forget to timetable a week (or equivalent) for PLoP paper
- Very happy with the way the notes have developed
- I’ve been looking at CLA for Hyperreal, maybe we can have a think about that during our planning session
