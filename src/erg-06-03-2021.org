** Noorah
- Andy K‚Äôs doughnuts
- Things to do in Austin!
- Vaccine Monday!
** Joe
- Charlie learning Org Roam... explore the org file structure
- Heading, properties, exporting
- Helm-BibTeX...
- Attendance of Emacs-SF (as a podcast!)
- They are the ones who encouraged Noorah to present at EmacsConf
** Raymond
- NYC Emacs was this past Monday
- After stormy relationship decided to say goodbye to dydx!
- Goes back to fluxions df(x)/dx ‚Äî lots of differential equations
- Had a nice discussion about possible plans about ob-servant
- This notation saves time from switching between symbols
- They didn‚Äôt have the right notation for functions...
- Could this notation have changed things?
- Design principles: if things are left implicit and not written down you can forget - and realising when this happens
** Cameron, David
** Leo
- Bug report on switching timer - Chat with zanzi
- Was late b/c Leo was in the train & EmacsConf meeting
- Talked a lot w/ Joe about Hyperreal
- Things coming to an end w/ government
- Broadly spent about 14 hours in Emacs meetings (Paris, M-x, Emacs SF)
- Like a second job, felt manageable, happy about this

* Things to keep in mind
** Points can be added to PARs mid-session, no need to wait for the end
** Record the sodding session

* Agenda                                                               :90m:

** Effort estimates

- Mostly working but will need some refinements

** R Studio                                                            :60m:

*** Noorah‚Äôs presentation
:PROPERTIES:
:EFFORT:
:END:

- RStudio is an IDE built on top of R
- Have integrated Python code as well
- Types: Text
- JC‚Äôs feedback on R Studio
  - Felt reminiscent of org-mode/cider, C++, for today will look at R Markdown
- Similar to Org, and how to create a quick website

**** Setup
You get a pop-up wizard; ‚ÄòShiny‚Äô is interactive; you can download templates (e.g., similar to Tufte style documents)

- Sheringan: nice HTML presentation style
- Enter the name of the contributor per package

Set up HTML file; you can export in pure MD

- Uses Knitter to export
- You can change the date to have it automatically update

**** Basic features

- Provides a nice data browser that keeps track of variables you have used
- In the data export you can add dependencies
- It will print TeX file
- Knit to HTML, Word, LaTeX: this creates the export
- Noorah has edited the =pandoc= setting to change the font in the backend (it uses Calibri by default)

**** Question
- RSP: What features do you find that are most/least useful/productive?

**** Comments
- The environment (data browser) is hard to do in Org mode
- You‚Äôd have to type up the export
- It gives you lots of tabs to be able to use things like Github and so on
- With the console, it populate things on the side: it‚Äôs helpful and very user friendly...
- However it doesn‚Äôt have the headers and thing
- The free software version is /more hackable/?
- But if we compare Emacs with a lot of things it has user friendliness... could we add some of the user-friendliness in Emacs?

And, even though this is the free version, there is a company behind it: whereas with Emacs it‚Äôs whoever is doing work at that time.

- RSP: Could we have a workflow that has both?  Get them to work together?
- Leo: Working on Zotero connection these things can be more hassle than it‚Äôs worth.  People who know how to do org mode will be happy with elisp but not with other stuff
- Emacs: it‚Äôs nice to be able to customize it in elisp! Whereas with RStudio it‚Äôs way harder to customize

**** Next part: Project creation

- You can use different packages through the browser in lower-right pane
- The thing that‚Äôs also a big deal with the R project (similar to projectile); once we create a project we can associate it with a directory, and you can choose what type of project you‚Äôre creating (e.g. Distill website)
- It can give some permissions issues
- Can configure it for Github pages, or use netlify (Leo + Cameron use it regularly) ‚Äî Github pages is also easy
- ‚ÄúDemo ERG Website‚Äù on Github pages, can use the Github desktop app to show

**** 20 more minutes!
- Creates index, docs, you can browse contents inside
- Github desktop... this is good for folks who want to learn how to do this but don‚Äôt have the time to learn how to do it
- ‚ÄúAdd Existing Repository‚Äù
- It‚Äôs user-friendly (Github Desktop all set up)
- This is now up in the Github account, we see it inside Github
- To use Netlify... just drag and drop a file
- Can link it to Github, it takes a little while to publish
- Org Roam is very opinionated, but ‚Äòbacklinks‚Äô could be merged into Org ‚Äî then what is Org Roam? It‚Äôs something that allows you to play with backlinks
- Maybe writing the side-buffer is the proper use for this thing
- How do you build an interface that makes it easier?

**** Example
- Sef van Buuren has written a nice book in Bookdown
- You can integrate hypothesis with such a website

**** Random
- Next directions! ‚Äî Peeragogy Handbook chapter?
- RStudio desktop as a development base and they then move it on to /cloud computing/ products

**** Pain

- Why does it not quite work inside Emacs?
- Webscraping database...
- Org file with literate programming
- Different chunks of code in Org mode
- You can create chunks in any type of language!
- But if you look at the R part =Rterm= program not found
- I don‚Äôt have time to do all the configuration
- It fires up a session
- Need lots of configuration; once done, it will print the results
- BUT what I have to do is /call a session/ ‚Äî in RStudio the session is assumed ‚Äî but in Emacs you need to manage it
- When I open the R Session in another window or frame, it freezes (though, this is a Windows issue according to ESS maintainer)
- JC is reminded of Cameron‚Äôs experience w/ TRAMP
- Since Org mode can run all kinds of things... you do need to give it some directions
- If we make backlinks native in org-mode, we need to think about ‚ÄòWhat is a backlink?‚Äô, e.g., M-TAB in typical windowing system
  - Creating a workflow snapshot (according to NA)
  - Backlinks could have this /evolutionary/ component (‚Äòlet‚Äôs go back to the state of computation before, before I modified this variable or corrupted‚Äô)
  - Covering an entire surface of evolution (‚ÄòAdjacent possible‚Äô)
  - Familiar from our discussion of generic trace in October 2020
- Reminiscent of *Reflog* project inside Magit, which shows the whole history of interactions
- Reminiscent of Nero (based on Conkeror, the web browser)
  - Features like ‚ÄòAriadne‚Äôs trail‚Äô
- The thing we were doing in ob-servant would be keeping track of the data we would need to do that
  - Similar to the data

**** Relationship to Org Roam
  - Org Roam 2.0 ‚Äî simplified database?
  - Trails will be consecration of this.
  - Maybe interesting to have a Datomic backend?
  - Or have a standard and make the database interchangeable?

**** Feedback on Noorah‚Äôs presentation
- Great! üëçüëçüëç

** M-x Research debrief                                                :15m:
:PROPERTIES:
:Effort:   0:15
:END:

- Github inside Magit
- Have a visual way to retrace our steps
- JC is concerned about the female representation in this group
  - With M-x Research, 1 in 12 was starting to feel weird (what about EmacsConf?)
- NA: They were talking about ‚ÄòEmacs Pinkie‚Äô and for me I don‚Äôt use my pinkie to type anything, my pinkie is too small! I use my ring finger! And I have arthritis so sometimes it flares up ‚Äî maybe they don‚Äôt have a clue about gender issues
- And a general issue ‚Äî in Peeragogy working on gender balance actively since pretty much the beginning
- Also working on this with the EmacsConf group (taskforce working on the topic)
  - Maybe we should focus on the research?
- Deb and other stuff to look at about this from research side... but maybe people get to a point where ‚Äúwe‚Äôve done enough and now move on‚Äù
- Diversity issues can be a nightmare to address
- The task force disappears when it‚Äôs dissolved
- But you get a bunch of half-measures that aren‚Äôt really resolved
- Office hours will have metrics that we could work on
- RSP: Around the time that personal computing came around, this was when the gender divide in computing came in ‚Äî they became ‚Äòtoys for boys‚Äô at that time (Cf. Mar Hicks, to think about how did it come)
- If we are thinking about the future of work it‚Äôs not going to (weirdly) just be the male half of the population doing this
- NYC one has done quite a bit of steps with a /code of conduct/ to make sure they have a safe space...
- ‚ÄúSoftware development is just about software‚Äù  ‚Äî ends up with only men! ...
- So we need to modify the rules (4 Freedoms)... Netbeans can also be hard, but where can you ask questions?  Who has access to the questions, and what‚Äôs the response.

*** Come back to the M-x Research debrief during the week
- EmacsConf discussions getting going in mid-April

** LV‚Äôs Crowdfunding                                                   :5m:
:PROPERTIES:
:EFFORT:   0.05h
:END:

- Leo has been thinking more, talked with Sacha
- SC is extremely excited about it
- LV also getting much better at describing it:
- (I) *Mediation*,
- (II) *Coherence* - Melpa to core but in an intelligente package, thinking about coherence in Org Mode system, e.g., backlinks must interact nicely
- (III) *Community*. E.g., EmacsConf office hours, whatever ERG wants to put forward.

*** Hints: Emacs Paris & SF
- People there are friendly and excited about LV stuff
- Emacs SF was excited about this
- One of the people wanted to make contents on Org Roam
- ‚ÄúYou are changing the mood and making it more geared to in-depth discussion.‚Äù
  - At first this seemed negative (LV has been to two meetings but it‚Äôs ‚Äúso much better since you arrived‚Äù)
  - But no, you owe it to the organizers
- JC‚Äôs take on LV‚Äôs intervention at Emacs-SF
  - LV might have undersold himself there; these were the results of method and discipline that
  - Could offer practice time

** CLA review                                                          :20m:

- The discussion was postponed last week to give more time to the discussion with Mark

*** [[file:cla-20-february-2021.org][file:~/projects/exp2exp.github.io/src/cla-20-february-2021.org]]

- Noorah: Is there a way to use NLP to get to this? I.e., NLP to get to document from atomic ideas? Does NLP play a role in coherence?
  - LV: You need to ask it to do something... humans are struggling already, so asking a machine to do it seems out of reach
  - ‚Ä¶However, this could be within a 5-year plan
    - TODO: Discuss this with Deyan?
- RSP: the sentence about ‚Äúthe big themes that come up‚Äù
  - Two big problems came up in today‚Äôs discussion: /Gender balance/ and /ob-servant and talking about backlinks in a general way/ ‚Äî How these things in Emacs work at a higher level
    - Historical/genetic approach on how we got there (Foucaldian archeology?)
    - Worth noting themes like this
- This CLA could form the basis of how we present ourselves, i.e., page 1 of our whitepaper
- Ray‚Äôs point about giving more space for discussion during interviews
- LV: The approach to ‚Äòmethod‚Äô seems to be gendered, GTD stuff, this ability to step back and look at how you organise yourself ‚Äî this is a leisure activity.  If you‚Äôre stripped of this b/c of motherhood, or plus having a job ‚Äî it strips one from having the ability to organise oneself
 - E.g., ‚Äòglass prison‚Äô is another level of imprisonment
 - Being kept in a status where there‚Äôs no opportunity to reflect on method
 - The deprival of time
- NA: It‚Äôs also about representation and not enough mentorship to attract a diverse group!
 - E.g., people of colour can be deprived of time as well
 - Other folks similar to Black Panthers or feminism who will have thought of these things
 - Cf. example of learning Lakota ‚Äî this element of diversity can be used to tap into more diversity

* Ongoing projects & Next actions
- Noorah & Charlie exploration of org-roam/org-mode/org-ref/bibtex-completion
  - Screensharing

- Inviting people related to diversity issues (// EmacsConf)
  - shoshin?
- Creating a front for ERG
  - Web-page
  - Opening the meeting to other people
    - WIP with EmacsConf

* PAR                                                                   :10m:

:END:
*** 1. Review the intention: what do we expect to learn or make together?
- JC had a tough week, and really enjoyed the support he got from HyperReal
  - ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs not just about individuals; the community is itself a strength, and meeting regularly is creating that space, because we can count on one another.‚Äô
  - We‚Äôve gotten to know one another to the point where it‚Äôs become tricky to find the common denominators of the group
    - If we picked ‚ÄòGender & FLOSS‚Äô, we know we‚Äôd use the tools to do what we wanted to do
- RSP: ‚ÄòThis fits very well with the diversity discussion we‚Äôve been having today‚Äô
- View RStudio presentation and think about
  - We had a good discussion where we tied this to Emacs
  - It was good to see some code and some visualisation
*** 2. Establish what is happening: what and how are we learning?
- It‚Äôs been a while since we had David or Cameron
- Things running well in Ray‚Äôs research project
- We got a look at Noorah‚Äôs thesis layout with Zanzi, and a demo of using Emacs to run bibliography
*** 3. What are some different perspectives on what‚Äôs happening?
- The PAR can still be difficult to navigate
  - The self-reflexive PAR!
- JC‚Äôs discussion with Charlie
  - Charlie is in a very different position from Joe, but they‚Äôre both working with people learning data analysis skills
     - (CD: on the job or JC: MSC students)
  - Using the techniques which have been deployed in the Peeragogy project in ERG from the start was a good bet
- Timer *almost* worked automatically
*** 4. What did we learn or change?
- PARs worked for ERG, but did they work for EmacsConf?
- Would we need a different kind of organisation for this?
- Sacha‚Äôs buy-in is a complement! Right time, team of people that she‚Äôs working with
*** 5. What else should we change going forward?
- We‚Äôre getting to a point where we can do a shared research project
- Federating the groups around Emacs, or creating a global Emacs research, is probably what we should be striving towards
- We would be ready to receive visitors at some point...
- Could learn from EmacsConf as they try to do this

* Check-out (exceptional or not)

** JC
- Feeling energised
- The Peeragogy podcast coming out on <2021-03-12 Fri 21:00> might be
** NA
- Great session!
- Happy about her presentation on RStudio
- Ready for a delicious lunch created by her partner!
** RSP
- Good session overall
- Interesting discussion of observant & traces: things to get back to
- Looking forward to continue some things in coffee time
** LV
- I‚Äôm glad we had some time to do checkouts before the clock runs out
