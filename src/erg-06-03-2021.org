*** Intro
- Leo thinking about the future
- Nothing set in stone
- Thinking about: financing Org Roam with milestones
 - But Org Roam is interesting but a bit shaky/narrow
 - So thinking about ‘diluting’ to something wider
 - Something that would be interesting would be mediating between packages not in core & those in melpa
 - This is generally a political question... E.g., syntax libraries, string-parsing libraries
- LV: Someone with experience with melpa packages, and org mode maintainers
 - Can be a missing link
 - Motivation sharp around merging things into core (a lot of people who develop packages can’t be bothered; there can be some posturing & ‘dumb refactoring’ involved)
- So, what about stepping into this role, and surveying the field to look at what’s worthwhile?
- Looking towards coherency between packages, e.g., /what if... Org Roam could play better with Org Agenda?/
 - Mark: I have played briefly with it and would like to use it more!
  - You have to schedule time for learning things!
- #orgroamcult 

*** Situational Report (SitRep)
:PROPERTIES:
:Effort:   0:05
:END:

- LV: Has been talking with Jethro this morning
- First touch-base in a month
- Jethro calm and able to think about Org Roam but doesn’t have as much time
- He was completely on board with the Kickstarter project though can’t join the project now
- Would be happy to keep working on Org Roam
- Regarding the finances €17K→€20K (Kickstarter takes a margin)
- (€40 if we increased it to a one-year stint)
- Next week to meet with Tarsius (developer of Magit) to probe his mind
 - He got $88K for Magit development
- Also will plan to talk with Sacha to get her input
- Aiming for 15th of March ‘to get started’, but need to finish things up
- Thinking about the nature of the job based on Ray’s input, and the ‘end user’
- Need to be exploiting my ability communicate about what I’m doing with Emacs
 - Exchanges like this discussion now could be shared
 - So 50% development+politicking (Bastien can help) + 50% community (have been training)

*** Discussion
:PROPERTIES:
:Effort:   0:20
:END:
- RSP: may have feedback in some afternoon
- 15th of March is probably unobtainable...
- Mark: this is interesting — the community is diverse
- You want to be appealing to a broad cross-section of community, not everyone who uses Emacs is as well-versed as ‘we might be’ (?)
- There are lots of people in the community who might not immediately be aware of the benefits something like this might give!
  - So whatever you do needs to be very clear to people who are more peripherally involved
  - People who use it as a day-to-day text editor
  - We might be able to distil milestone-based stuff
  - Also good to have vlogs to keep people in the loop
- Look through M-x Research archives to see what a more representative set of people talk about?
  - Might help us prod what people are talking about (to gauge interest for some features)
- Mark: We have some records that are somewhat in this vein; we recorded the sessions
- The record
- Mark was hesitant on sharing recordings or logs as to create friction with some people
  - JC: At the same time, this is preventing us (ERG) to get up to speed
- Maybe a ‘focus group’ could be worthwhile rather than just mining their records
 - If there was a more central focus group that we’d run that we could point people to...?


* PAR                                                                   :10m:

:END:
*** 1. Review the intention: what do we expect to learn or make together?
*** 2. Establish what is happening: what and how are we learning?
*** 3. What are some different perspectives on what’s happening?
*** 4. What did we learn or change?
*** 5. What else should we change going forward?
