#+TITLE: How to Design Programs
#+roam_tags: HD

We were thinking of /How to Design Programs/ (HtDP) as a potential basis
for our approach to *teaching arbitrary programming*.  We would want to
respect category theoretic concepts in the presentation.  We would
expect to find analogues in settings like Bayesian modelling.

We could proceed by looking at relationships with argumentation
theory, thinking about how to do this in a theoretically consistent
way.  Once we have a definition of the programming language we’re
going to use, we can then do argumentation over that.

Another strategy would be to develop a DSL for HtDP ideas, which we
could then reuseq to generate patterns for learning how to design
various structures (say, web pages or probabilistic programs).  To do
this well you’d need ways to express ‘recipes’.  For example, an MVP
might be based on representing HtDP-style recipes using sequent
calculi for session types.  These represent interactive protocols.

You’d use cut-elimination to have two players interact (using
something like the **Lakatos Game diagram**).  But what formalism
would you use?  E.g., /geometry of interaction in linear logic/ has
been used for this kind of thing, but could it be used here?  With a
suitable formalism in place we would then imagine that a computer
programming agent would just follow the “Lakatos Game” style HtDP
script.  So, this would contribute to the development of agent models
for programming and program-related Q&A.
