* Rough Guide to “Building a Better Conversation”

We will adapt a version of these rules:

1. Each player uses an independently constructed deck of 100 or fewer cards; each card can contain any information whatsoever (typically they will include a title).
2. Players start with 5 cards in their hand, and play one card each turn, drawing one new card at the end of each turn (when the draw pile is depleted, play continues with the cards in hand).
3. A card is either played face up and remains in play for the rest of the game, or discarded, face down, to the player’s personal discard pile.
4. When playing a card face up, the player must state the card’s interpretation within the current game; essentially, why it is being played.
5. Every play should relate to at least one previously played card, continuing and adding to the discourse.
6. Blank cards drawn from the deck can be converted to non-blank cards on-the-fly, then played (but can not be played before being so converted).
7. Play ends either when all of the players discard in succession, or one of the players can not play because of being out of cards.
