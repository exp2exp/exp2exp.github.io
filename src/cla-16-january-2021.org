* Objective for this session?

‘What is our vision for change and how is progress measurable?’

** Understanding data, headlines, empirical world (short term change) :data:
#+begin_quote
- We need to be collectively confident on the major themes (maybe set a realistic deadline at the end of Feb)
- Maybe add a couple of demos for this quarter (assigned and on the calendar)

** Systemic approaches and solutions (social system) :system:
#+begin_quote
- Requires a larger community of contributors for it to work.
- How do we differentiate authorship in those notes?
- Our work needs to be public first before we can embark on this project.

** Worldview, ways of knowing and alternative discourse :worldview:
#+begin_quote
- /Practice/: Different to ‘method’ (the latter is more top down)
- *Collaborative is a key theme*
- /Talking about actualizing what we’re doing/: This keeps popping up, so might be worth discussing tomorrow.
- Now we try to integrate *my* (Noorah’s) thoughts on a set of notes that we create together across time (30th January)
  - Annotations and history
  - “Bookdown” to create book in Markdown?
  - *Hypothes.is* to have access to WIP (https://via.hypothes.is/https://www.gnu.org/)
  - Trying to structure my dissertation, which has many parts; and I have a committee that needs to comment on progress
    - How is the progress of an applicant/researcher measured?
      - Visible outputs of research; // quantifiable research
- We started off with PARs, then we started thinking through our past PARs, then observing /patterns/...
  - https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03736
  - Seeing patterns require a high-level view.
  - ‘Patterns’ as ‘projects’; parallels to LV’s workflow?
  - How can we make our patterns work in a collaborative fashion?
    - e.g. having similar patterns with Qiantan; how do we share?
    - Linked to /common ground/?  How do we find common ground with people?  Technically speaking, but also methodologically/practice-oriented speaking

** Myths, metaphors and narratives: imagined (longer term change) :narrative:
#+begin_quote
- /Method/: This keeps popping up too. We may need to decide on a few activities/deliverables, just something more tangible.
- /Link between method & practice?/  Actualising what we’re doing
  - What gives an *Objective* character to what we’re doing?  (It’s fine to do something that we’re enjoying, but there must be something about actualising.  Even if it were just fun; how can we make it so that even more fun.
  - Top-down approach of method vs. the bottom-up approach of practice
- https://hbr.org/2005/07/learning-in-the-thick-of-it
- If we tackle big enough projects would create need for collaboration /en train/
