* 01 October 2022  — Emacs Research Group


* Check-ins
:PROPERTIES:
:Effort:   0:15
:END:

** NA
- Had a long week, and the next one might be just as busy.
- Okay so far, and want to work more on the workshop.
- Lamenting the lack of time spent on Emacs on recently.

** JC
- Late, was at garden, not feeling great
- Preparing for 4th International Conference on Anticipation
  - *4 November 2022 Virtual.*
  - 16-18 November 2022 Tempe, Arizona USA.
- Want to prepare on design patterns.
- Met people in a non-profit called [[https://earthwatch.org.uk/news/blogs/589-engaging-environments-seeking-nature-finding-community][Earth Watch Europe]], and they seemed to be interested in building communities, organization, volunteering, and all this kind of stuff.

** LV
- Very long week; working more than 25 hours on prepping for the conference.
  - Had to spent all day sending out acceptance notices
- Back to working on algorithms to better for the job market.
- Discussion about time-tabling w/ Abby
- Thinking about ‘computer aided Org Roam’ — thinking about all the stuff that this could be might be living inside a query language

* Meta points

** DONE Don't forget to record the session!                             :LV:
CLOSED: [2022-10-01 Sat 16:30]

** TODO Pre-PAR — Review the intention: what do we expect to learn or make together?

*** LV:
- Switching everyone to org-roam's v2, at least for =exp2exp= (10'),
- Calendar for preparing the EmacsConf presentation (5'),
- Reviewing the content of the presentation in the face of the downgrade to 20' rather than 40', and the possible further downgrade to 20' (10').

* Agenda (Part 1)
:PROPERTIES:
:Effort:   0:20
:END:
** Moving to org-roam v2

- Do I need to have the =.dir-locals.el= in everyfile?
- We haven’t got any immediate blockers to changing exp2exp to OrgRoamv2.
- A few files here and there might need some updates
** Calendar for EmacsConf submission

** Discussion on the presentation
- JC: Last year, the presentation was a little robotic.  Maybe we could do something with a pseudo-host asking questions!
  - NA: I do like this format the format!
- JC: Maybe we want to expand further than what we did last year.
- NA: Let’s decide on the number of interview questions.  Maybe 2–3 might be good, especially if there’s a back-and-forth
- JC: An interview might work really well.
- JC: We could with minimal post-processing: record it 7′ at a time (one question, one answer).
- [[https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/526527461/wildebeest-mask-gnu-mask-diy-printable][Gnu Mask]] possibly useful in this context
** Good to get it done sooner rather than later

** JC’s presentation on his future section (possible Phase 3)

*** Special emphasis on two candidate requirements
- What are the things we ‘need’ as ERG, from the point of view of software?
- Of course it depends on our purpose

** Query language
- You put in queries and get results
- But what are the functions that are being run?
- E.g., regexp is a similar thing (find all matches for =E.*G= in a file...)
- But we could add anything, using AI or whatever else to make those connections
- Thinking of “I’d like to see the orphans in my Org Roam repository, I’ll get the computer to help with that.”
- We can also do things like: “create new nodes by default: what if your collection of notes could evolve, and the computer can compute new links for you to consider overnight.”
- What’s not covered by the query language?  Presumably not some other hooks that manage the workflow of interaction with the system.

** Can we...?
- Embed a model so that everything we push can tell us “hey, this note that you just wrote up is similar to these three other notes”
- Imagine you save the file, the code will then go and try to find salient points in other files that are similar
- So this isn’t a query that the user types, but it’s a type of query itself
- And furthermore, once you save a file, the model updates
*** Could we use the notes from the first year as a baseline and see how they evolved?
- The model could rank similarities between documents, and if we have two notes that are highly similar, it’s an indication that we’re not innovating
- If there’s a weak link then maybe there’s something more to develop
- In the context of the workshop, we have 2 phases (I) Problematization and (II) Solution-finding; can we use the data from the problems as a baseline.
- This is similar to how
** Blockers
- ‘Find salient words in a buffer’ is some NLP stuff
- JC: Let’s team up on this
- LV: Possibly difficult to achieve some of this w/in the time

** Work arounds
- Worst case scenario, we can can act like the system and say things like “do you remember when you said X? It seems related to Y”.

** Current working implementation
- Noorah has a python script for *topic modelling*, but it doesn’t currently update on entry of new texts
- Alex has another super simple script for doing *bags-of-words* models
- Even if we just create a wordcloud that doesn’t have a lot of processing

** Mockup
- If we get this working inside Org Roam adapting the current script isn’t hard
- Updating the model on entry might be more complicated
- In the case of PlanetMath, we’d have titles and synonyms "Gaussian distribution" and "normal distribution", and these would be introduced as links
- What if we have a ‘glossary’ where we can say *Gaussian distribution is is the same as normal distribution*
- We can store IDs
- We can also make the glossary a tree, w/ parents/children, other hierarchical relations
- We could further refine the suggestion model w/ a taxonomic model
- Practicing algos would make me good at finding networked relationships between headlines, rather than just looking at a row of trees

** Getting started
- Maybe we want to think about “the taxonomy” as a slipbox of its own
- Or maybe we want the taxonomy to be a tree of topics
- Or the file could be the patterns
- We can have a recipe for the semantic recommendations
- Whenever there’s a new word, the system might say, “this word seems to belong to a new category, would you like to enfoef in to a new category?”
- Could we use [[https://en-gb.padlet.com/][Padlet]] as a simple thing?
- Well, worth weighing our options if what we could do w/ our time is create a padlet clone
- LV: I have a snippet-processing Pastebin-like book, I can look into it
- Padlet doesn’t have a real API but does have CSV export
- What might be easier would be to run our own version of Etherpad, we can set it to allow CLI interaction

** Closing
- Can we create a basic website, we enter text, the text goes into a CSV file that has columns like IP address, body, user
- 20m to 1d time needed
- Alex might have already implemented this :-)
- Maybe we can have a suitable demo for the tech workshop (≈ 1 month from now)

*** 1. Establish what is happening: what and how are we learning?
- JC: I’m feeling better
  - Thaw began earlier, got better as we got to "Phase 3"

*** 2. What are some different perspectives on what's happening?
- JC: Quite liked bringing in NA’s Python qualifier work as a new oldstock theme for us here
- JC: Session feels dynamic

*** 3. What did we learn or change?
- Is this the first 2h session w/ just the three of us?  Seems so.  It was good.
- Even if it was 1h30 working after a 30 checkin, we still felt better

*** 4. What else should we change going forward?
- Fix our web publishing /sometime/; maybe off the back of the new tool that we’re building!

* Tentative agenda for next week
- JC + LV will meet often!
- Work on EmacsConf
- Let’s confirm meeting plans with Abby

* Check-out

** NA
- After: lunch!

** JC
- It’s been a rather stressful week/day.
- Been sleeping better recently (except last night).
- It’s time to relax some more!
- Good to restart serious work on Monday, unless it helps me relax earlier :-)

** LV
- Glad we’re finished w/ this week’s EmacsConf, health stuff, meetings?
- Looking forward to two weeks that are less busy, will enshrine working on algos; to cement a habit you need 3 weeks!  Use this time judiciously.
