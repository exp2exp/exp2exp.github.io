#+TITLE: Initial ML baseline, e.g., match Q-A

This remains a pretty straightforwardly “doable” task if we were to
get things loaded up.  After taking a stab at things within the the
HEL sessions, I could presumably take that as a curriculum to be able
to get this running after several months (with adequate help from Tim
and Deyan).  However, it’s less obviously useful... if we can’t do the
“hierarchical ML” next step.
