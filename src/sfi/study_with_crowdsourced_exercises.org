#+TITLE: Study with crowdsourced exercises

“Crowdsourced reading comprehension questions and simple exercises
derived from existing Q&A would provide a further route to
evaluation.”

So the idea here would be to pay people to come up with some
SQuAD-like questions and answers based on existing Stack Exchange
problems.  This would help build a catalogue of the kinds of things
we’re looking for inside of the Q&A items.
