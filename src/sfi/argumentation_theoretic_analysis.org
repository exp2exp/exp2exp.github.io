#+TITLE: Argumentation-theoretic analysis

I’ve started to look at some of the Q&A items to see whether there’s
anything there we can extract.

This isn’t yet the same as an argumentation-theoretic analysis, but I
can imagine returning to this Q&A stuff through the lens of the
earlier papers, and see what we could do to argument-mine them.  That
could lead to the “FARM 2.0” paper that Ray and I have often
discussed.
