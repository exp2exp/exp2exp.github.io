#+TITLE: Agent modelling and sandbox setup

This seems to be the main outcome of the Active Inference bootcamp.

Could we set up a simpler agent learning paradigm, and progressively
run it in long epochs, in which the agents learn more complicated
skills each time?  E.g., learn how to upvote, learn how to retrieve
relevant concepts, learn how to structure them into sentences and
paragraphs?

Maybe itâ€™s worth looking around at some of the other Stack Exchange
sites to get inspired, or have a think about what domains the Q&A
approach might be especially suitable for.  (E.g., are there any open
source SQuAD-performant systems that would naturally lend themselves to agent
modelling?)

Or, what about the question of turning Stack Exchange into a set of
rewrite rules first, and basing the agents on those rules?  If we
think about things in terms of rewriting, then maybe each rewriting
step could be viewed as a Q/A pair.  So then, we could look at any
open source rewrite system and try to give a score to rules based on
how often they are used.
