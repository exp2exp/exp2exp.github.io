#+title: Active Inference bootcamp

Cameron talked a bit about active inference, and his Bayesian stats
background is relevant to making sense of whatâ€™s going on in here.
Lots of other papers are available, including some by Beren Millidge
if we wanted to start making models of agents.

We could also think about these models in terms of Tangled Program
Graphs or some other reinforcement learning paradigm.  E.g., Zans and
I talked about making an upvoting bot.  If we could moreover learn the
actual features that go into good questions and answers, then those
could be used on the generative side too.
