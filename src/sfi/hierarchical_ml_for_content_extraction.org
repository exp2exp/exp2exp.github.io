#+title: Hierarchical ML for content extraction

I guess part of this would be to do first Coarse Discourse style
detections, then move from that to more specific models.  During the
HEL sessions I don’t think we’ve made any directly tangible progress
on this goal.  I did find references to /CROKAGE/, which I should follow
up on.  Still, maybe there are some alternative ways to make progress
here that should be thought about.
