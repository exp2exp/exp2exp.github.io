#+TITLE: ML/NLP bootcamp

I got some insights from both Tim and Deyan about what is directly
possible to do with existing tools.  We didn’t yet progress beyond
some initial “failed” experiments and partial work. However, in
principle we could go back to it and try to do Q&A matching.  That’s a
low-level task.
