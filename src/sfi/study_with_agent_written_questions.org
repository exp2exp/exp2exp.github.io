#+TITLE: Study with agent-written questions

Can agents come up with questions to ask about a given question that
break it down into more do-able components?  Can we gain leverage by
“Asking questions about Stack Overflow questions”?

What sorts of Q/A structures might go in to reading and comprehending
a given question?  Maybe, again, we could think in terms of rewrite
rules.  “Here is a portion of text that is unclear.  Let’s try to see
what the author was actually trying to say.”
