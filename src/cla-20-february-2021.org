This refines the previous [[file:cla-20-february-2021.org][CLA 16 January 2021]], which covered Episodes 1-6.
Perhaps we should delay ‘finalising’ this for a couple more weeks, so that we can also have 6 episodes to look back on.
But we might as well start now so that we don’t have to do it all at once!

* Objective for this session

‘What is our vision for change and how is progress measurable?’

** Understanding data, headlines, empirical world (short term change) :data:
#+begin_quote
- We’ve made progress since we started with the raw /themes of Emacs and Research/ 
- Add a couple more demos for the next quarter, following up on our existing work.
- Decide on a few tangible activities/deliverables — but this can also take an ‘agile’ approach.
- Celebrate what we have done! — “If we knew what the outcome was it wouldn’t be research”. Have a role for serendipity

** Systemic approaches and solutions (social system)                :system:
#+begin_quote
- Requires a larger community of contributors for it to work.
- How do we differentiate authorship in those notes?
- Our work needs to be public first before we can embark on this project.
- We’ve got a workflow with careful review and diagnosis of issues when expectations aren’t met
- CLA is useful as a reflective tool but there are others as well!
- Looking at RStudio as a model of the kinds of things we want to do. RServer allows collaborative writing and editing, but is expensive ($5000 for 5 users). Compare also RStudio Cloud. For people who use R as their main language, they use this.
  - We could schedule a person specialised on R-Studio to come present us the piece of software (à la Google Doc presentation)
  - Learn from parallel projects; Mark had video introducing people to Spacemacs
- Expectations might not be met, but we are practicing the things that we’ve learnt; it’s what makes it systematic (the machine that builds itself again).

** Worldview, ways of knowing and alternative discourse          :worldview:
#+begin_quote
- ‘Practice’ and ‘method’ keep coming up (respectively, more bottom up and more top down ways of actualising what we’re doing)
- If we tackle big enough projects, it will typically bring with it the need for collaboration
- *Now* (30th January) we try to integrate *my* (Noorah’s) thoughts on a set of notes that we create together across time. How does this work? — But do we care about this in our workflow?  We could keep track of who created what with properties: do we want/need to persist these things? All the CRDT logs to file?
- Saving the buffer with the text properties could do it.
- What problem are we trying to solve? Instead of having a shared Org Roam directory, having ways of managing sharing of notes.  When and where do we really need this?
