I consider how people live their own life from their first-person
perspective, following the curvature of the day, setting goals or
drifting; learning sometimes.  I touch on the difference between the
individual and the collective and how this Simondonian viewpoint seems
to restate Spinoza’s two attributes in a different way.  Then I start
to think about how it is that whatever we might do as individuals, we
don’t seem to have a good viewpoint into what’s going on at the
collective level.  Surely, there must be something like the equivalent
of a few different 10000 page novels written every day.  First
question, is how those stick together?  Second question, what would it
be like to slow down our pace of life to not just weave a new version
of this novel/tapestry every day but to read it?
