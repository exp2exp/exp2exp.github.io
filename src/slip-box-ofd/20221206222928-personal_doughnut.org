* Problem

Informed by [[id:56ce8d31-d3d6-4493-bb41-b07d810afbcc][Causal Layered Analysis]], at the workshop we were ready to
work across levels — but did we have the /correct/ set of levels for the
‘public space & public health’ setting front-of-mind?

* Solution Strategy

Something that came up in the discussions around the workshop and
PLACARD method was our prominent focus on /the wellbeing of
participants/.  We could frame this in a rough analogy with Doughnut
Economics, HOWEVER the framing would be different in this small-scale
format.

BECAUSE ‘health’ is inherently a complex topic — e.g., considering a
“bio-psycho-social” or “bio-psycho-social-eco” model — there are
multiple moving parts.  If we want to talk about health effectively in
future versions of the workshop, we might want to rethink aspects of
the workshop itself using /these/ components; e.g., the “roles” that we
use in Phase II could potentially be rethought this way.

Since we cannot be guaranteed to have teams of participants with expertise evenly
divided along the bio/psycho/social/eco components of health,
THEREFORE, it could be useful to survey some of the other frameworks
that are out there that could be relevant to this reframing, so that
we could get creative about reconfiguring them.  Examples might
include [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manfred_Max-Neef%27s_Fundamental_human_needs][Manfred Max-Neef's Fundamental human needs]], Schwartz’s [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Basic_Human_Values][Theory
of Basic Human Values]].

#+begin_quote
/According to Schwartz, individual values are responses to three
universal requirements of human existence, namely needs of people as
biological organisms, of agreement in social actions, and of survival
and well-being of groups./
#+end_quote

SPECIFICALLY, the axes and dimensions that were used to organise
scenarios (in-balance vs out-of-balance, scarcity, aliveness,
availability of knowledge commons, etc.) provide a very rough
framework that was generated by participants.  How would we analyse
our workshop’s framework in terms of the bio-psycho-social-eco model
of health?  Does it have natural ‘habitable zones’ similar to the Kate
Raworth doughnut?  One limiting factor that was drawn into the diagram
was based on language/access/education.  Since many of our solutions
were related to /communication/, these do seem to be relevant factors.
How do these limiting factors show up around active participation in
(both) [[id:57f06710-a96c-4cbc-bcc7-57d3d3e550c4][Public Space & Public Discourse]]?

* Validation

In the full Bristol workshop, we continued to use the CLA levels, but
we presented them as a set of concentric circles, both in our framing
presentation, and in visual templates that we distributed to
participants (see images below).

This reframing of the suggests an analysis of the layers in this order
of descent:

| Psycho- | Litany    | Observables        |
| Social- | System    | Factors and actors |
| Bio-    | Worldview | Attitudes          |
| Eco-    | Myth      | Shared values      |

** Further comments unpacking that

It makes sense that /observables/ would be top of mind in our
psychological make-up.  We’re also able to perceive aspects of the
social world, though without reflection, we can be more driven by
immediate sense perceptions than the more complex relations which give
rise to those perceptions.  We also bring many well-documented biases
to our cognition and emotion, based on the long history of human
evolution.  Nevertheless, we are now also aware, at least in the back
of our minds, of ourselves as part of an ecological system
(cf. /Nouvelles du monde/, by Serres).

** Further links with the design pattern format

The table above can be extended directly to incorporate our four-part
pattern format:

| Psycho- | Litany    | Observables        | /HOWEVER/      |
| Social- | System    | Factors and actors | /BECAUSE/      |
| Bio-    | Worldview | Attitudes          | /THEREFORE/    |
| Eco-    | Myth      | Shared values      | /SPECIFICALLY/ |

Again, some brief remarks to narrate this extension.

/Conflicts/ exist at the observable layer.  They may be well-known
blockers or simply annoyances.

/Causal/ relations are typically derived from social relationships.
Here it may be useful to recall George Mead’s reframing of ‘sociality’
in terms co-evolution or change (which is then reflected in our
awareness).[fn:: George H. Mead, /The philosophy of the present/, Open
Court, 1932.]

# #+begin_quote
# What is peculiar to intelligence is that it is a change that involves
# a mutual reorganization, an adjustment in the organism and a
# reconstitution of the environment; for at its lowest terms any change
# in the organism carries with it a difference of sensitivity and
# response and a corresponding difference in the environment. [...] Now
# what we are accustomed to call social is only a so-called
# consciousness of such a process, but the process is not identical with
# the consciousness of it, for that is an awareness of the situation.
# The social situation must be there if there is to be consciousness of
# it.
# #+end_quote

Our /dispositions/ to action are filtered through our consciousness,
with reference to our existing repertoires of action.

Lastly, although our /values/ are not always top of mind, they are not
ephemeral, but are, rather, among the most concrete things that we
perceive when, to use a tun of phrase, we see with our eyes closed.
Specific actions which are not already-programmed by our existing
/patterns of action/ are likely to relate to these values.  (Here we
could refer to, e.g., Spinoza’s ethics.)

** More specific relationship to the Raworth doughnut

With these comments in mind, the relationship to the Raworth doughnut
becomes clearer.  ‘Eco’ is at the core of the CLA model, but the
periphery of the Raworth doughnut.  An ‘overshoot’ of the /ecological
ceiling/ corresponds, here, to living a life not in line with our
values, or even more fundamentally to values which underspecified.
Similarly, a ‘shortfall’ relative to /social foundation/ relates to the
underprovision of public goods and to the /fragmentation/ of the
ecosphere in individual minds (often, themselves, fragmented by
craving).  We can do something about this in local communities if we
[[id:0f9e1955-845f-419d-bb55-70051d5df2c3][Rebalance social services]].

This also suggests a strategy for ‘patternizing’ materials from the
workshop.  During the workshop itself, we already began to [[id:6ec29348-55cd-404b-b352-238db7f85b72][Identify
core concepts]].  This gives us a picture of the ‘myth’ layer.  From
there, we should be able to work back to new and possibly quite
different social relationships.
