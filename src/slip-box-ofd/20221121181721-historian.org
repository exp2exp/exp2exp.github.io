* Summary

*Context* When developing a vision of the future. *If* people start to
agree BUT no one connects it with local history and concrete actions,
then work bogs down; *Then* use words like "/specifically/" to connect
abstract problems and solutions to specific actions.

* Details

Like the [[id:a0796d9e-664b-46fa-bb37-7f6a6fc15584][Kaijū Communicator/Wrinkler (♘)]], the Time Traveller should
also work across contexts, but the contexts are specifically linked by
(temporal) /evolution/.
