Like the [[id:a0796d9e-664b-46fa-bb37-7f6a6fc15584][Kaijū Communicator/Wrinkler (♘)]], the part of the Analyst’s
role is to work across contexts, looking at external articulations.
The other part of the analyst’s role is to look within the context at
internal details of articular.  For this latter purpose, [[id:56ce8d31-d3d6-4493-bb41-b07d810afbcc][Causal
Layered Analysis]] is one useful technique.
