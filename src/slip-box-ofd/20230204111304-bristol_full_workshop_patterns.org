#+title: Bristol Full Workshop Patterns

Itâ€™s easiest to get started with the patterns that were identified in
Phase II:

- [[id:0f9e1955-845f-419d-bb55-70051d5df2c3][Rebalance social services]]
- [[id:65b47a3f-914b-470c-8aa4-2662bd391c8e][Funding of public space]]
- [[id:44d1d5dd-d8ff-4ce4-8d9e-dd5f7c8f8c06][Contested space]]

From these, we should be able to work back into the Phase I materials.

E.g., the first one that occurs to me is:

- [[id:73ebb973-f06c-4394-bd91-59b67dd4a7db][Building at the boundaries]]
