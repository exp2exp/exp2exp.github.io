* Problem summary

If we take it as given that “Bristol needs to grow” (a debateable
point), then it can either grow intensively with higher-density
housing, or it can grow extensively by building at the boundaries.
Both of these have some associated challenges.  Here we consider
strategies for building at the boundaries.

* Solution summary

This should relate to the ‘Avon Mouth’ discussion, see ‘Group 3 details’. 

This relates to the concept of [[id:4ed30e8c-784a-401e-9631-add816f8c2be][Boundaries]].  It also relates to both
the [[id:86d1669e-bd6c-487b-a8f1-3ca8a211817f][Tension between public/private]], and [[id:9574546b-4e65-4f40-89e0-95bf41b7eb87][People vs. Nature]], insofar as
the ‘edges’ may be (or may be perceived to be) closer to wild space,
and as such may be conceptualised as ‘external’ and ‘public by
default’.
