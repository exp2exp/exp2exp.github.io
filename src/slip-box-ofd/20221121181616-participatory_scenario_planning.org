#+title: Participatory Scenario Planning
#+filetags: :HL:WS:

* Summary

*Context* you want to plan for possible future scenarios. *If* you have
an interested group BUT no "expert" has all the answers; *Then* pool the
collected expertise of the affected communities.

* Instructions

** Overall process

- The initial input are participants' individual reflections on the workshop theme ([[id:615846a2-1795-40b4-8dfb-3e12923fccc0][Dérive Comix]]).
- Make sure we use consistent terminology, e.g., [[id:d7c5081f-cc76-4893-9daa-ff13b9bf1ae2][KW: Scenarios]].
- We want to make one or more big mind-maps ([[id:407beae8-ab2f-4340-9552-211d3b92ede6][Meaning Map]]). This can be structured by further activities:
  - [[id:a853be79-85c1-4ffa-9750-459192c539e8][Find the dots]]
  - [[id:0ef4b185-513f-40c2-b884-6213601bbe09][Advice from a Caterpillar]]
- Participants may have skills to bring to the table, so this is a good opportunity to [[id:902d27f7-26c7-488b-baa7-5b973a850359][Transfer control to participants]].
- These can be improved by coming up with dimensions in which things can optimise in some direction (good/bad) ([[id:105e0ad7-ada7-4cee-b2c6-a68d08096159][Dimension analysis]])
- Once we have dimensions, we can describe scenarios that merge the themes and dimensions, outlining possible directions of development ([[id:7357a42a-9691-4669-92c3-895d9061dda5][Build Scenarios]])
- The maps can be enriched by bringing in areas of expertise ([[id:bf8791b5-e50b-4666-bc01-286e279a5971][Reinfuse Expertise]])
- Post Phase 1 immediate feedback; check on participants (like a mini-PAR).

** Materials
- Big sheets of paper

** Intended outcomes
- Merge everything into one big shared possibility space
- Identify core issues

** Responsibilities of facilitators

- Move things along, e.g., so that we identify and elaborate the blockers, but don’t get stuck on them
- Merge and evolve the mindmaps both within groups and across groups
- Identify [[id:d7c5081f-cc76-4893-9daa-ff13b9bf1ae2][scenarios]].

* Phase I Feedback

** Improve processing of input
- Consider *centralising the data*, since a lot of stuff is currently buried.
- Explain where the notes are, how to find the LaTeX files, git repos, &c.
- This follows patterns of the EmacsConf organisation, e.g., minimal commits, logs, etc.

** How to merge multiple mindmaps?
- *Merging* might be easier to do with software, without them, you can get a spaghetti-fest; distilling, by asking "What are the key nodes?"; it feels like this is particularly important.
- Building something that distills the info

* Phase I Evolution
