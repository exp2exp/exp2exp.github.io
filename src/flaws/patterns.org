*** About this pattern
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern
    :END:
Bicycles are a low impact means of transportation, particularly for
trips under 5km distance. They are an important, cost-effective means of
reducing traffic density and promoting healthy exercise. Community-based
cycling groups should be formed to promote cycling as a means of
transport. For instance, /Bike Marrickville/ is a volunteer-run group
of residents promoting cycling and improving the local environment.
Local groups can be affiliated with Bicycle New South Wales, the peak
body organisation for the promotion of cycling and cycling safety.

*** Pattern Conditions
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions
    :END:
*Enablers*

- The development of safe cycling infrastructures, marked lanes,
  separated pathways, adequate signage, laws that protect cyclists and
  their access to roadways. Digital platforms have made safe route
  planning far easier in Sydney.
  ([[http://www.sydneycycleways.net/map/]])

*Constraints*

- Cycling infrastructure and signage remains limited in Western Sydney
  in particular. Some areas are totally unsafe for cycling. The cultural
  climate and practices of motorists can make cycling unsafe.
- Lack of storage and shower facilities can limit the ability to use
  cycling as an alternative form of commute transport.
- Cycling may not be advisable during heat emergencies and also at times
  when bushfires bring smoke into cities.

*** Commoning Concerns
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns
    :END:
*Cycle Club* as social commons/transit

*Access:* Open to cyclists/commuters.

*Use:* Transportation and recreation, conviviality.

*Benefit:* Exercise, safety, reduced fossil fuel emissions, reduced
congestion.

*Care:* Community based organisations.

*Ownership:* Community residents.

Promoting access to cycling means challenging existing patterns of
development, transportation and infrastructure as well as cultural norms
around transportation and comfort at work. Cycling culture can be gender
and class exclusionary---its accessibility to women, low-income or
disabled populations would also require sustained advocacy and
facilitation from cycling advocates/organisations.

*** About this pattern
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-1
    :END:
For the first five years after a project delivery, the development
organisation and residents are responsible for existing public trees and
new ones, after which local government authorities take over caring for
them. Those first five years are vitally important if the trees, planted
and existing, are to be healthy and long-lived. During this time, the
community and development organisation can establish policies and
strategies for site trees, so that local government can continue with
the foundational tree management afterwards, including the on-going
appointment of a respected arboriculturalist.

Often people are afraid of big trees in public spaces or private gardens
because they may drop branches or fall on cars or houses in severe
storms. This can be addressed by *consistent arboriculture care* (for
instance visit the Arboriculture Australia website in resources
section). Trees can be encouraged to grow in particular shapes to remain
amenable to social commoning. There are various stages to caring for
trees so that branches do not fall, and trees remain healthy.

*First, trees need deep friable soil, air and water*. For trees in open
space, start with the Keyline method of preparing planting areas (see
the KEYLINE pattern). This will ensure healthy soil and water for good
growth. Tree planting in streets and public space need adequate areas
and depth of soil (see the pattern SELECTING SHADE TREES FOR PUBLIC OPEN
SPACE)

*Second, check and manage trees for insect pests* Providing the proper
cultural care in accordance with climate and needs of a tree species is
the best way to prevent insect infestations. Eucalyptus trees, for
instance, appreciate supplemental irrigation during prolonged dry spells
and experts at the University of California Integrated Pest Management
Program suggest watering eucalyptus plants once a month with a drip hose
until the top 12 inches of soil become moistened and performing
maintenance pruning when pests are waiting out the winter season, in
order to avoid attracting insects into freshly cut wood tissue (see
Kelsey [n.d.] in the references below).

*Third, prune and maintain branch and trunk health* to keep structural
soundness to withstand storms and strong winds. This can include
reducing the weight of the canopy by selectively pruning the ends of the
branches.

*Cable and brace* where branches need more support or have been damaged.
Cabling keeps tree branches from splitting at their junction. This
involves attaching various types of cables to stronger branches, the
trunk, the ground or other anchors. Cabling can also be used to support
unusually long limbs or reinforce weak-wooded species.

*Dynamic Cabling* (or */‘Cobra'/*) allows the limbs to sway, putting
less stress on trunk and branches. Thus, tree continues to produce
*reaction wood* (special cells) in response to wind or other stresses.
Dynamic systems generally use synthetic ropes instead of cables, and
they usually wrap rubber around the branches being supported, rather
than relying on metal hardware that has been screwed into the tree.
*Cobra**system* is a dynamic tree support system specially designed to
be flexible and shock-absorbing with different benefits:

- Gentle to trees, self-adjusting to the diameter growth of tree,
  requires practically no tools, and incorporates a shock-absorbing
  unit;
- Avoids defective growth, the ‘karate effect', abrasion and
  constriction, wounding;
- Encourages trees to grow reaction wood.

Cobra system components include cobra rope, anti-friction hose,
expansion insert, shock absorbers (Arbor Culture Pty Ltd, n.d.)

*Crown thinning and lifting* allows more sunlight to pass and air to
flow through the canopy. This is done by removing some secondary
branches. Crown lifting raises the height of the crown and allows more
space underneath for lawns and gardens.

*Good Arboriculturalists can undertake these procedures and maintain
your trees with annual inspections.*

*** Pattern Conditions
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-1
    :END:
*Enablers:*

- Undergrounding powerlines means trees can grow full mature form.
  Streets can become signature avenues.
- Assisting local government to lobby for TAFE course on Arboriculture.
- Establishing a caring for trees community group is a positive step.
- Tree care gives opportunities for residents and children to learn to
  be ‘citizen scientists' by monitoring specific trees (see Australian
  Citizen Science Association in the resources section).

*Constraints:*

- On-going cooperation with local government during and beyond the
  five-year period.
- Protocols required to prevent storage or emerging structures within
  canopy drip-line.

*** Commoning Concerns
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-1
    :END:
Canopy Trees are one of the most effective ways to cool commons. ‘Cool
commons' are spaces and places offering cooler temperatures than
surrounding areas. Such commons are used by, and are accessible to, a
community of commoners who, to some degree, care for, take
responsibility for, and benefit from this coolness.

*Access:* Unrestricted access and involvement; restricted when
undergoing care

*Use:* Recreation, Biodiversity, wildlife corridors

*Benefit:* Environmental benefit, carbon capture, amenity of public
space

*Care:* Developer; Local Government; Body Corporate; community;
arboriculture consultancy.

*Responsibility:* Developer; Local Government; Body Corporate;
community.

*Ownership:* Body Corporate; community.

*** About this pattern
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-2
    :END:
*Cool Winds*

*Site planning for coolth requires mapping prevailing winds; cool winds
in summer and cold winds in winter.

*Using tree planting to direct cool winds and block cold winds, can
create turbulence on both sides of solid barriers. This contrasts with
open canopy and open fencing, where the wind can pass through without
turbulence. Groves of trees, rather than rows, effectively channel
prevailing winds and achieve greatest density of canopy when species are
mixed.

**Canopy Density is increased when trees are crowded; crown branching
changes with crowding, providing shorter primary branches and more than
twice the volume of other branches. The branching is flatter and crown
volume is bigger.

****Sun/Shade*

Site planning for coolth also requires a sun/shade analysis for 9.00am,
12.00pm, 4.00pm throughout winter & summer.

Winter sunlight is best achieved with deciduous trees. The quality of
shade depends on trees' attributes including leaf area; high branch
density; multiple canopy layers; canopy transmissivity; canopy size and
projection and canopy ventilation.

*** Pattern Conditions
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-2
    :END:
*Enablers:*

- Channelling summer winds to cool open space can reduce temperatures &
  humidity. Blocking winter winds facilitates warmth;
- Summer shade is increasingly essential, as is winter sun.

*Constraints:*

- Tree management to achieve healthy growth and arboriculture care to
  prevent falling branches is essential.

*** Commoning Concerns
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-2
    :END:
*Access:* open access for public open space; wheelchair access under
trees in groves is a dilemma, as it will inhibit soil and root health.

*Use:* recreation, wildlife corridors, shelter, carbon capture,
O_{2}/CO_{2.}

*Benefit:* human comfort, environmental contribution.

*Care:* essential arboriculture, irrigation, fertilization.

*Responsibility:* Local Government, Corporate Body of Building owners,
communities.

*Ownership:* Corporate Body of Building owners.

*** About this pattern
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-3
    :END:
The walking school bus concept originated in Japan, but was popularised
initially in Australia. Programs now exist throughout the world that
organise groups of students travelling together on foot to school or
other destinations, under the supervision of staff and volunteers. The
walking school bus is seen by policy makers and local authorities as a
way to promote safe exercise and conviviality, and to reduce traffic
choke points associated with the school commute.

*** Pattern Conditions
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-3
    :END:
*Enablers*

- There are many online resources that can be used to develop walking
  school bus programs.
- The efficacy of these programs can be greatly improved by the
  development of policy guidelines that attend to both the safety and
  walkability of local environments.
- Brightly coloured jackets for the children are a good idea.

*Constraints*

- Walking school buses may not be advisable in areas where traffic
  patterns and the built environment preclude safe pedestrian pathways.
- Programs may not be advisable during heat emergencies or other adverse
  weather events.

*** Commoning Concerns
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-3
    :END:
*Walking school bus* as social commons

*Ownership:* Participants (state and federal government).

*Access:* Open to participating families that have organised a walking
school bus program.

*Use:* Safe and convivial walking transportation to and from school or
other destinations.

*Benefit:* Transportation, exercise, safe and convivial transport to and
from school and reduced traffic congestion around school sites.

*Care:* Distributed among parents and volunteers participating the
walking school bus program.

*Responsibility:* There are significant concerns around the question of
responsibility: how to keep children safe during these activities and
who bears this responsibility (in New South Wales this lies with
participating parents and caregivers).

*** About this pattern
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-4
    :END:
Trees that people love, create special places. Private trees have
personal meanings to the people who planted them. They are often planted
for their colour, flowers, & shape (see the pattern SELECTING SHADE
TREES). Trees need care such as watering, pruning and checking for
insect attacks (see the pattern CARING FOR TREES).

Often people are afraid of big trees in private gardens because they may
drop branches or fall on houses in severe storms. But trees are living
beings so selecting the tree(s) for a garden will depend on how much
space and deep soil is available. Site planning for private garden trees
also requires mapping the prevailing winds so that garden trees and
shrubs can channel cool breezes and screen winter winds. Also, where
garden tree(s) are placed will depend on their purpose; that is, whether
it is to shade the house and garden, provide privacy or to be a personal
garden feature. It is a good idea to therefore map garden areas that are
shaded in summer & are sunny in winter (see the pattern SITE PLANNING
FOR COOLTH).

*Using trees to make special places*

Garden trees can create special spaces for children; the spreading fig
for instance can make an outdoor room and is easy to climb. Pairs of
columnar trees like small poplars can make a gateway to separate one
garden space from another. A weeping garden tree, such as white cedar or
Golden /Robinia/ can also create a shady nook for reading on a
comfortable garden seat.

*** Pattern Conditions
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-4
    :END:
*Enablers:*

- Private trees personalise individual houses and are driven by people's
  needs and aesthetic taste. Cooling shade and winter sun improve
  comfort within private homes.

*Constraints:*

- Some Local Government Authorities have Tree Preservation Orders which
  require permission to fell garden trees.
- Current Urban Growth Release developments do not have enough garden
  area or soil to support shade trees.

*** Commoning Concerns
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-4
    :END:
*Access:* private and shared where trees overhang fencing or cross
demarcated private/public zones

*Use:* Shade, aesthetics, children's play, wildlife habitats &
corridors, food production.

*Benefit:* Emotional well-being, climate amelioration, carbon capture,
benefits for bird life, outdoor coolth that allows people to reduce
their indoor use of air conditioning.

*Care, Responsibility and Ownership:* Private owners.

*** About this pattern
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-5
    :END:
Ways of welcoming are important for the convivial orientation of
newcomers to the culture of a place. Cultural orientation might include
community-led governance structures and protocols, commoning practices
within the neighbourhood, and specific coolth promoting practices that
are already in place.

This could take the form of a pack with a range of material elements
like maps, contact lists, invitations, keys, gifts. It could also take
the form of a protocol for a trial ‘live-in' period, short visits, or
stays for visitors and prospective buyers. Learning from ‘screening'
protocols such as those enacted in Poundbury to ascertain value
alignment (but without the elitism [Beamish, 2017]), this process
enables prospective residents to experience and contribute to the
community of commoners who meet regularly to discuss ways of organising
events, processes and systems.

*** Pattern Conditions
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-5
    :END:
*Enablers*

- The ‘trial live in' can be streamlined into the handover process when
  potential buyers are looking to assess the benefits of living in the
  area. No external policy framework needed to implement this.

*Constraints*

- Streamlining involves a lengthier hand-over process with greater
  resource allocation. The Welcome Pack needs to be iteratively updated.

*** Commoning Concerns
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-5
    :END:
*Access:* All residents, potential residents.

*Use:* Community engagement is sustained and introduced as integral
component of the settlement.

*Benefit:* Handover processes are clearer, with goals and objectives for
cooling set out at the outset.

*Care:* Residents' community, liaison officer.

*Responsibility:* Partnership between developer and community.

*Ownership:* A share house and community-centre could be owned and
maintained by the developer.

*** About this pattern
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-6
    :END:
Accessible Water is a pattern that promotes the integration of water for
play, drinking and cooling into the public domain, to enhance space
cooling effects through evapotranspiration and personal cooling through
contact with water. In low humidity, peak ambient temperatures can be
reduced by three to eight degrees Celsius
([[http://www.lowcarbonlivingcrc.com.au/sites/all/files/publications_file_attachments/rp2024_guide_to_urban_cooling_strategies_2017_web.pdf][Guide
to Urban Cooling Strategies]]).

It might be in the form of splash pools or small rills and misting. It
is an important /infrastructure of care/, enabling people to move
comfortably out and about on hot days or nights and a way to enhance the
quality of outdoor play spaces, particularly during summer. It requires
thought about how people move through the city and where and when they
seek to gather, as well as the nature of the space where the water is
made available, so as not to create any harm to people. For example,
water play spaces should meet the NSW
[[https://everyonecanplay.nsw.gov.au/][Everyone Can Play]] guideline.

Accessible Water is an addition to swimming pools and Water Sensitive
Urban Design (WSUD) features that are important for retaining water in
the environment. Measure of success for these public spaces include
maintaining full accessibility and operational up-time, and also
maximising attendance.

In addition to WSUD features, making the most of access to existing
natural assets is another important means by which neighbourhoods can
benefit from coolth. In particular, still water bodies such as lakes,
ponds and pools provide opportunities for people to relax and cool down
by padding or swimming. Ideally public water bodies will be most easily
accessible from the shallow end.*

Still water provides opportunities for the community to relax around the
water edge, for instance, stairs can provide seating for water places
that have a slope. Seating also allows for natural surveillance, which
aids safety.

*** Pattern Conditions
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-6
    :END:
*Enablers:*

- Strong community support for accessible water across different
  delivery modes.
- Cooling and liveability city plans (e.g. Penrith City Council, 2015;
  Parramatta Ways Walking Strategy, 2017) and academic research (Mellick
  Lopes et al 2016; Mellick Lopes et al 2019) signal accessible water as
  a key consideration to enhance community cooling, participation in the
  commons, and urban walkability.
- Availability of a natural water area such as a lake, pond or river
  that can be retrofitted for public use.
- Artificial features such as ponds can be adapted for access if they
  have shallow access points and slip resistant surfaces. Pond surrounds
  can often be easily adapted for safe use.

*Constraints:*

- Drought conditions may limit water for play.\\
  Usability and toxicity of still water needs to be assessed and meet
  safety guidelines.
- Material and finishes selection must consider slip and trip hazards.
- Risks of ultraviolet radiation and sunburns if shade is not available
  will need to be actively managed by those responsible for the common.
- Opening hours of most parks and water play areas currently limit
  evening use.
- The community may have varying degrees of comfort with delineating
  human, animal or shared use of the common.
- Still water quality must be suitable for public access. Some water
  bodies become more polluted following rain. This should be signposted
  to ensure safe access and use.

*** Commoning Concerns
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-6
    :END:
Accessible water is a key infrastructure of care to support commoning.__

*Access:* Designing for equitable access is an important consideration
and should apply Universal Design Principles wherever possible.
Decisions will need to be made around the shared access with animals.

*Use:* When the common is typically enabled by the land or asset owner
for improved amenity, its use would not need to be negotiated by the
community. In some instances, in the case of still water reserves for
instance, swimming, paddling, resting and socialising with friends and
family might be negotiated with communities involved.

*Benefit:* All residents, visitors, birds and animals benefit. Space can
be provided for wildlife; a place for the community to paddle, swim and
cool down.

*Care:* Shared between asset owner (i.e. maintenance, repair) and
commoning community (monitoring and some day to day care and maintenance
related to still water resources). Local Bushcare groups can play a
vital role in some bushland water bodies.

*Responsibility:* While the asset owner would have a legal
responsibility, the commoning community would be required accept the
risks associated with the use of the potentially dangerous common.

*Ownership:* Local government; National Parks and Wildlife Service. The
systems which ensure the safe operation of the infrastructure, along
with the asset itself is typically owned by a local council.

A commoning concern will be tolerance for shared use, human and animal.

    :END:
Communities are complex and they experience the physical world in
diverse ways. There are differences between the elderly, youth, children
and different cultural groups in terms of the ways they use and enjoy
public open spaces. Some parks in Japan have included sensory devices
for both visually and physically impaired visitors that enables them to
enjoy the coolth provided by still water (see the pattern ACCESSIBLE
WATER).

[[http://danishdesignreview.com/kbhnotes/2018/7/20/sansehaven-garden-of-the-senses][The
Garden of Senses]] in Copenhagen is the largest public sensory garden in
Denmark. It was designed by Landscape Architect Helle Nebelong who
specialises in gardens and playgrounds for children with a disability.
Here: “Plants are chosen for their distinct shapes and there are herbs
for their smell or even their taste” while “the dense but low planting
also shields the garden from the more noisy and boisterous park beyond
to make the space feel somehow calm and protective” (Nebelong, n.d.).
Her desire is for the people who use her garden /to touch, smell and
listen if they cannot see,/ /to touch, smell and see, if they cannot
hear and/or/ /to touch, smell, listen and look at anything within their
reach if they cannot walk./

Meanwhile, budding gardener programs give children the opportunity to
explore the plant world and discover the miracles of gardens.

    :END:
Cooking facilities built into parks allow for wide access and use.
Outdoor cooking reduces heat and moisture inside buildings during
periods of heat. Cooking spaces benefit from the inclusion of overhead
shelter to protect cookers from direct sunlight but need to be well
ventilated.

Outdoor cooking facilities attract gatherings of families and friends,
encouraging shared cooling outdoors. They can be an important part of
both day and night-time use of parks that are central to local
festivities, sports events and social events such as children's birthday
parties (Özgüner 2011).

*** Pattern Conditions
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-8
    :END:
*Enablers*

- Grant applications to funded community health and sports programs can
  include budgets for developing outdoor cooking areas.
- Appropriate tree shading and seating (see the pattern GATHERING
  OUTDOORS ) for eating areas will encourage use.

*Constraints*

- Facilities need to cater to diverse cultural cooking practices
  (Özgüner, 2011).
- To attract night-time usage, facilities need to be appropriately lit.
- Stoves and barbecues can be dangerous to the unskilled, such as
  children. Cooking facilities need to be user-friendly, and inclusive
  for people of different cultures and people with disabilities, as well
  as being well-maintained and kept clean.



*** Commoning Concerns
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-8
    :END:
*Access:* Access for all in the community.

*Use:* Public events, festivities, concerts, sports, outdoor party.

*Benefit:* Reduced indoor heat from cooking during hot and warm months
of the year; conducive to active and healthy communities.

*Care:* Local Government Authority; private landowner; land trust;
community of commoners.

*Responsibility:* Local Government Authority; private landowner; land
trust; community of commoners

*Ownership:* Local Government Authority; private landowner; community
land trust

Generally outdoor cooking facilities are provided on a first come, first
served basis. During peak park use, scheduling access to cooking
facilities may be required to ensure a clear and fair process. Users can
be enabled and encouraged to keep cooking facilities well-maintained and
cleaned after each use through appropriate signage and the provision of
cleaning equipment. Gathering to cook outdoors on hot nights can become
a social ritual. Cooking smells can elicit complaint.

*** About this pattern
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-9
    :END:
Protecting, maintaining and growing street trees requires a long-term
commitment. With care, trees should be long-lived, healthy and provide
increasing shade to enable cool streets. The attention to good growing
conditions and on-going tree management that maintains shade-giving
canopies suggests that installing and caring for street trees should be
done in unison with urban water management. (See the patterns MANAGING
ON-SITE WATER & CARING FOR TREES).

*Growing conditions -- soils*

The designated area for street trees is restricted requiring site and
technical planning for adequate soil volume. Soil depth is important,
but more essential is the soil area for roots to spread and access
oxygen. Because of competing users in streets -- pedestrians, services,
vehicles -- the maximum area for lateral root growth can be achieved
through porous paving and grass from property boundaries to kerbs.

In paved plazas, the use of Structural Soil Systems (SSS) composed of a
two-part system of cellular modules for strength and structural support
(load bearing) and filler soil can enable tree growth. In this way,
structural stability is provided, plus interconnected voids for root
penetration, air and water movement.

*Growing conditions -- water*

Water-sensitive urban design can ensure that water reaches the roots of
the trees; this includes redirecting kerb water through spaced inlets
into the tree pits.

*Tree Selection*

- Ten criteria are relevant to street trees in urban environments:
- Drought & Heat tolerance are increasingly important in UHI. Isolated
  trees can experience high heat and radiation loads in urban areas,
  increasing tree water stress; plant trees in groups to mitigate this.
- Wind tolerance is relevant as urban trees have to withstand
  turbulence.
- Tree longevity is reduced in urban environments.
- Pollution tolerance: the effects of pollutants on trees can cause the
  tree to weaken and die. Most pollutants to trees are airborne,
  including oxidants, sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide; sunlight
  reacts with oxidants to form tree pollutants such as ozone.
- Pathogen and pest susceptibility and manageability
- Potential as allergens to humans and animals: of the 50,000 different
  kinds of trees, less than 100 have been shown to cause allergies; most
  allergies are specific to one type of tree or to the male cultivar of
  certain trees.
- Shade cast (see the pattern SELECTING SHADE TREES)
- Maintenance required; this is generally higher in a younger tree in
  order to attain the form needed to suit site constraints.
- Tree litter: all trees will shed litter, leaves, bark, flowers or
  fruit at some time during a given growing season. Plane trees drop
  hard fruit which can be a pedestrian hazard.

*Size Matters*

One strategically located large-stature tree more impact on conserving
energy and mitigating the urban heat island effect than a corresponding
quantity of smaller trees. Larger trees do more to:

- Reduce stormwater run-off.
- Improve local air, soil and water quality.
- Reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide.
- Provide wildlife habitat.
- Enhance the attractiveness of an area.
- Promote human health and well-being.

The bigger the tree, the larger the benefits and, ultimately, the better
the community's quality of life.

*Siting*

Shade trees in public open space can be situated beside paths, around
gathering spaces and can provide shading for play equipment. The canopy
shape determines most effective shading (see the pattern SELECTING SHADE
TREES).

*/Street Tree Considerations **/*

- A shade rating greater than moderate to heavy:
- Requires high maintenance; requires formative pruning; has low litter
  drop;
- The minimum height clearance required under canopy is 4.6 metres on
  roads and 2.5 metres on footpaths.

- Establishing an “Urban Forest Stewardship” group
  ([[http://www.treefolk.org/ufs][www.treefolk.org/ufs]]) where
  residents care for trees through local civic groups and social
  networks.
- City of Sydney & City of Melbourne both have guidelines and technical
  guides for street trees. City of Sydney Urban Forest Strategy sets
  targets to increase average total canopy cover by 50% by 2030 and 75%
  by 2050, meaning that canopy cover percentages should increase from
  the current 15.5% coverage to 23% in 2030 and 27% in 2050.
- Local Government is responsible for trees in parks; Roads, Maritime
  Services are responsible for street trees; AUSGRID is responsible for
  pruning street trees.

*** About this pattern
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-10
    :END:
*Water Sensitive Urban Design* (WSUD) is a form of water management for
on-site storm water and runoff. It involves capturing and storing
stormwater, reducing water consumption and impact on local water
systems, and improving water quality. This is achieved using grassed or
landscaped swales, infiltration trenches and bio-retention systems,
gross pollutant traps, wetlands, sediment ponds, rainwater tanks for
storm water harvesting and as cooling devices, rain gardens, rooftop
greening and urban forests, porous pavements, aquifer recharge and
reuse.

*Rain gardens and bioswales* are vegetated depressions located on
gradients. Their main function is the retention and infiltration of
stormwater. Acting as a filter for runoff from permeable surfaces, they
reduce pollutants which enter storm systems. They are a way to manage
bioretention areas by capturing and holding roof and road runoff but
will not maintain optimal drainage rates if soils become compacted, it
is therefore important to minimize foot traffic in this area, except
walking for maintenance. Regular applications of mulch maximize the
swale's ability to capture and break down contaminants. Rain garden
plantings should not be fertilized to prevent excess nutrients run-off.

*Structural soil*s are an engineered soil mix designed to allow three
functions: reduce pavement heaving and breakage; improve stormwater
infiltration; and improve tree growth. Structural soils can also
improve stormwater infiltration if covered with a porous paving material
(see Seattle Green Factor (2008 p.4) for more information). *Stormwater
planters* are containers designed to capture and either retain or
filtrate stormwater, based on their design. The amount and frequency of
water captured depends on storm events, so they should be populated with
a variety of plants adapted to both wet and dry conditions. Visually,
they can be striking landscape features providing a high functional
value.

Properly designed soil conditions are required to achieve stormwater
infiltration and increased plant growth. Deep soil is considered to be
that which is penetrating to base rock and water table. In planters,
soil depth should be a minimum of 600mm for shrubs and ground covers and
minimum of one metre for small trees.

*For improving water efficienc*y: rain sensors fitted to irrigation
systems can reduce water use; amalgamated planter beds will improve
efficiency of irrigation systems and mulch in garden beds reduces water
evaporation from soils.

*Permeable Paving*

Permeable paving allows sites to infiltrate stormwater in a way similar
to natural systems. Permeable pavements also restrict non-point source
pollution from entering surface water bodies, which helps keep creeks
and streams clean. Permeable pavements also contribute towards healthier
plantings because root systems are aerated. *Permeable asphalt* can be
used in some cases to replace traditional asphalt and allow for
infiltration of stormwater.

*Permeable concrete* can be used in place of impervious concrete in many
non-driving situations. Its use in parking lots can help reduce the
amount of stormwater runoff and non-point source pollution.

Instead of pavers, the top layer can be either 150mm of Permeable
Asphalt or 150mm of Permeable Concrete, layered over 150mm of Open
Graded Aggregate, layered over Geotextile on the existing subgrade.

*Irrigation*

An integrated irrigation system must suit site the condition and the
requirements of the landscape. Efficient irrigation systems include:
rainwater storage tanks; appropriate species selection; soil depth and
soil quality to help minimise watering requirements and use of recycled
water. TANKLESS Underground Rainwater Storage is one means to collect
quality surface rainwater.

*Using Storm Water for Wetlands and Water Features*

On-site storm water management can ideally finish in wetlands and water
features.

- Wetlands contribute important wildlife habitats and pleasant
  recreation areas.
- Water features can add interest to paved public spaces. Their wide
  range of design styles and possible functional attributes can make
  them useful elements for cooling and aesthetics. Water features can
  also be engineered to clean & aerate water as well as recycle it.

/Sustainable Sydney 2030/ targets include 10% of the City's water to
come from recycled sources and a 50% reduction in the pollution being
discharged into waterways. Within landscaped areas, Water Sensitive
Urban Design (WSUD) provides the means to achieve these targets.

*** About this pattern
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-11
    :END:
Heat stress can have a devastating impact on the animals cohabiting with
us in our cities. This pattern identifies (and provides a basis for
protocols for) infrastructures of care for cooling animals. These may be
deliberately designed permanent structures, such as Fiona Foley's Lotus
Line water sculpture at Redfern Park that invites multiple species;
architectural features of built environments that incidentally gather
water and/or provide shade; or more temporary solutions, such as bowls
of water put out for animals to drink. The provision of habitat is
another aspect of caring for animals in hot cities.

The need for infrastructures of care for cohabiting animals in the urban
common spaces is driven in part by human practices, such as water
diversion for irrigation.

Birds such as Ibises, which have migrated to cities because their
wetland habitats are disappearing, are perceived as urban interlopers --
alien and homeless. Cockatoos and Corellas have followed in their
tracks. Providing cooling infrastructures of care thus challenges
negative perceptions of animal-human urban cohabitation.

*** Pattern Conditions
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-11
    :END:
*Enablers*

- Creative thinking and engagement with communities to find solutions to
  questions such as: What are people willing to share? Not bubblers says
  Sydney Water -- therefore a need to move away from the bowl-like
  design of drinking water fountains.
- Delineating human only, animal only or shared use by design is an
  important condition of this pattern.

*Constraints*

- Competing interests around ‘water efficiency'.
- Policies limiting the access of animals to parks and other commons.

*** Commoning Concerns
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-11
    :END:
*Access:* While there are distinctive policies limiting the access of
companion animals to parks, public transport and other commons, the
point would be for such infrastructures of care to be as freely
accessible as possible.

*Use:* Thirsty, hot, tired animals; temporary and intermittent use.

*Benefit:* Animals, human carers, community of carers.

*Care:* Local Government Authority with community monitoring the
conditions of permanent structures. Temporary infrastructures could be
housed with other commoning resources and cared for by the community.

*Responsibility:* Local Government Authority and community of commoners
monitoring heat conditions and responding appropriately.

*Ownership:* Permanent water features owned by Local Government
Authority; private buildings and private gardens owned by residents;
commoning resources owned by community.

Commoning concerns include knowing how to safely help and manage heat
stressed animals; the impacts of large congregations of animals;
cleaning infrastructures of care; collecting animal poo; smells; bee
stings, bites and other injuries. Private residents may remove water to
limit animal access or thriving mosquito populations.

*** About this pattern
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-12
    :END:
Mobile play vans are free services offered by local councils. They are
targeted at children ages six and under (the preschool population).
They offer a regular schedule of safe and creative play and
socialisation space, and a chance for families with pre-school aged
children to meet and socialise, most often in local parks. These
services will be important when parks or other amenities are not yet
completed or have not yet matured. They are of great value in
communities where residents with young children have limited capacity
to travel to community centres or other facilities.

*** Pattern Conditions
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-12
    :END:
*Enablers*

- Council support is important.
- High-quality shade is essential if playgrounds are to be accessible
  during summer, while allowing for sunlight is important for
  comfortable winter access. Adaptable shade cover, for instance,
  deciduous trees and screens should be considered where appropriate.
- Designing for accessibility ensures that all community members can
  make use of a Play Van, including children with mobility restrictions,
  visual impairments and so on.

*Constraints*

- Mobile play vans require safe open space that is situated away from
  traffic but is also accessible for staff and participants.
- Current mobile play van programs do not run in conditions of extreme
  heat. They have also been suspended by some councils because of
  Covid-19, pointing to children's health and public health risks in
  general that have to be taken into consideration.
- The success of these programs depends upon council's willingness to
  fund outreach programs and to shoulder associated liabilities. These
  sorts of interventions become less important as community and
  community amenities mature.

*** Commoning Concerns
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-12
    :END:
*Play vans* as public commons

*Ownership:* Local Government; the community of users should also be
encouraged to have a sense of ownership.

*Access:* Children under age six and their family.

*Use:* Active and passive play by children; socialisation opportunity
for caregivers of young children.

*Benefit:* Gives children access to space to play; inclusion of movable
and adaptable resources encourages creative play; play outdoors has
health benefits and lessens the use of air conditioning for indoor play.

*Care:* Local Government generally has formal authority; local
communities, however, play an important role in ongoing careful use.

Programs like this should also make accommodations for the comfort of
care-providers during play activities. If the goal is community
belonging and cohesion, a chance for meaningful interaction among care
providers of young children is of equal importance. Programs could be
improved through incorporation of volunteer help, and with that comes
the need to ensure child-safety through background checks.

*** About this pattern
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-13
    :END:
Outdoor play areas provide resources and space for children and adults
to play, rest and socialise. Playgrounds should provide less structured,
natural materials and resources to stimulate the imagination and
encourage creative play. Objects that can be moved and creatively
adapted generate more engagement and creativity amongst users.
Accessible playgrounds and those that include sensory features, such as
plants that smell or feel interesting, ensure access for users of
different ages and abilities. Playgrounds should provide several
different areas for children and adults to group as well as to run and
move.

Outdoor play areas should be well shaded for access on warm days and
allow for sunlight in winter. Unshaded artificial surfaces can get
excessively hot during summer and should be avoided. In addition,
adequate /infrastructures of care/ should be made available -- for
instance water drinking fountains, seating to rest and accessible
toilets. Outdoor play areas should be centrally located and there should
be enough of them in a given area for locals to access easily on foot.

*** Pattern Conditions
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-13
    :END:
*Enablers*

- Planning for ongoing maintenance and management costs, including
  maintaining play structures as well as seasonal garden management. In
  New South Wales the government led initiative Everyone Can Play
  ([[https://everyonecanplay.nsw.gov.au/]]) provides guidelines for
  playground accessibility.
- For adaptable shade cover allowing summer coolth and winter sunlight,
  deciduous trees and screens should be considered where appropriate.
- Designing for accessibility ensures that all community members can
  make use of a playground space, including children and adults, people
  with mobility restrictions, visual impairments and so on.
- Designing for passive (e.g. sitting) and active (e.g. running,
  climbing, bike riding) recreational activities makes playgrounds
  useful for a broader range of users and in a range of heat conditions.

*Constraints*

- All playgrounds must meet Australian Standards
  ([[https://www.kidsafensw.org/playground-safety/playground-standards/]])
- Play areas that do not provide shade will have limited use on sunny
  days; similarly, dense shade will limit use in cool seasons.

*** Commoning Concerns
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-13
    :END:
*Ownership:* Local Government; the community of users.

*Access:* For all people if designed for maximum accessibility. //

*Use:* Active and passive play by children and adults. //

*Benefit:* Gives children access to ‘natural' outdoor space to play;
encourages creative play and collaboration among all age groups.//

*Care:* Local Government generally has formal authority; local
communities, however, play an important role in ongoing careful use and
can also be responsible for or engaged in periodic maintenance (if they
feel a sense of ownership).

One commoning concern is providing shaded seating for carers, who may
often be grandparents; another is encouraging a sense of ownership among
locals and other users.

*** About this pattern
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-14
    :END:
Every neighbourhood should include outdoor gathering spaces that
residents can use for relaxing and socialising with others. These spaces
can be co-located with outdoor play areas. Gathering spaces should be
delineated from the broader environment through the use of structures
such as seating, tables or shade structures that provide a sense of
enclosure.

Gathering areas should provide opportunities for large and small
gatherings. Ideally, they will include a combination of both permanent
seating and temporary seating that can be moved around to suit different
needs. Food preparation areas including barbecues for outside cooking
encourage use across the day and into the evening and they can be
especially valuable on hot days. Outdoor gathering areas should be
well-shaded for access on warm days and allow for sunlight in winter. In
addition, adequate /infrastructures of care/ should be made available
such as water drinking fountains, appropriate seating for different
demographics and people with disabilities, and accessible toilets.

*** Pattern Conditions
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-14
    :END:
*Enablers*

- Usable open space that can be retrofitted (hence this is suited as a
  remedial pattern) with seating and shade structures, ensures gathering
  spaces that are usable across the day.
- Trees and other shade structures that provide shade in summer and
  allow sunlight to penetrate in winter can maximise the use of
  gathering spaces across the seasons.
- Consideration for maintenance of permanent structures and gardens and
  care for temporary or moveable objects can bring greater involvement
  and sense of ownership among local communities.

*Constraints*

- Unshaded areas will not be usable in hot weather. Shade density is
  important in hot periods, therefore careful consideration must be
  given to trees and other structures that provide sufficient shade.
- While daytime use benefits from providing a sense of enclosure and
  shade, dense foliage at night can be perceived as unsafe territory and
  act as a deterrent if there are not more open outdoor gathering spaces
  available in the evenings.

*** Commoning Concerns
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-14
    :END:
*Ownership:* Local Government; the community of users.

*Access:* All people; birds.

*Use:* Resting and socialising with friends and family

*Benefit:* Socialising with friends and family outdoors; provision of
cooking areas such as barbecues provides the opportunity for outdoor
cooking away from the home on hot days.

*Care:* Local Government; engaged local communities.

A commoning concern related to gathering outdoors will be the management
of temporary fittings. This could be addressed by coming to arrangements
with civic-minded local shops or cafes to store resources for temporary
use.

*** About this pattern
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-15
    :END:
Quality shade is an important civic resource and is critical to human
thermal comfort (Bloch, 2019). Shade is often, however, unevenly
distributed across the city, with tree canopy roughly proportional to
household wealth (Greater Sydney Commission, 2018). Shade structures are
needed to provide immediate cool / protection from the sun in
environments (such as linkages, nodes or even building interiors), where
trees are absent or immature.

While shade needs to be considered as an integral part of the planning
phase, it is identified here as a remedial pattern as there are many
existing hot environments, particularly away from coastal settlements,
where the addition of shade could vastly improve comfort, accessibility
and use.

Shade can be fixed or dynamic, natural or artificial, hot or cool,
permanent, temporary or worn. There are also many different qualities of
shade: type, density, distance from ground and colour matter. Jacobs et
al. (2018) at University of Technology Sydney for instance monitored
climate adapted bus shelters and found a significant decrease in
radiated heat from the ceiling of these structures, largely thanks to
the insulated roof panels. Bick (2018), found blue shade sails provided
the most effective shade in a study looking at the reduction of light
intensity under different coloured shade sails. Shade from sails,
however, was not found to be as effective as shade provided by awnings
or natural tree canopy.

Trees provide the coolest and most amenable shade, so preserving mature
trees wherever possible is a critical first step. Trees provide critical
cooling infrastructure in cities and removing them, even if they are
replaced, represents a loss potentially of decades of shade, amenity and
habitat. In Stuttgart, tree preservation orders protect city trees that
have reached a certain circumference from removal.

In areas of urban growth, however, shade needs to be factored back into
environments from which trees have already been removed and ‘meanwhile
shade' will be required.

*** Pattern Conditions
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-15
    :END:
*Enablers:*

- Strong community support for accessible shade.
- Various cooling and liveability city plans (e.g. Penrith City Council,
  2015; Parramatta Ways Walking Strategy, 2017) and academic research
  (Mellick Lopes et al 2016; Mellick Lopes et al 2019) signal shade as a
  key consideration to enhance community cooling and urban walkability.
- Increasing urban heat due to climate change and rising incidents of
  skin cancer in Australia are conditions informing the need for shade.
  An ameliorating factor might be the increase of non-European migrants
  whose skin types are more suited to the Australian sun.\\
  Trees can be slow growing; therefore, other shade measures need to be
  sought.
- Cancer Council Shade Guidelines and promotion of climate defensive
  clothing including hats.
- Guide to Conducting a Shade Audit.
- Sun Smart policy has good traction in educational institutions.

*Constraints:*

- Limitations on planting new trees, shade structures and green façades
  for climbing vines include: available space in the street scape; the
  types of soil troughs required for planting; potential conflict with
  underground or overground utilities, and wheelchair access.
- Different trees provide different quality shade.
- Not all shade is equal -- the shade provided by a city building in an
  otherwise treeless environment, or by other people at a crowded,
  uncovered bus stop, will not cool! The material covering the ground
  and surrounds will influence the quality of the shade.
- Some colours are hotter than others. There is a need for community
  education around the thermal and reflective properties of colour.

*** Commoning Concerns
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-15
    :END:
*Access:* depending on where shade is installed it might enhance access
for public users, building users, animals seeking refuge from direct
sun.

*Use:* pedestrians, cyclists, building users, park users, animals.

*Benefit:* all; the lifespans of some materials and finishes might also
be improved with the protection of shade.

*Care:* performed by local government for public spaces; building owner
for private spaces; could be a community of commoners for living shade
or temporary structures.

*Responsibility:* all users; community might be tasked with keeping an
eye out for problems with shade structures and informing local
government or building owners.

*Ownership:* local government or building owners.

An important commoning concern is the ways in which shade can obscure
visibility. For example, a covered park might inhibit the view of the
night sky. Temporary shade to shield the sun during the day and open up
to the sky at night could be explored.

* Subcultural Boundaries

*** About this pattern
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-16
    :END:
The vast spread of urbanisation results in alienated people and
communities instead of a mosaic of recognisable suburbs that include
many subcultures.

Mosaics of subcultures need to be identified by boundaries, which are
like ecotones that allow for social mingling with other subcultures as
well as intensifying the subculture within the boundary. Such ecotonal
areas can be shared playing fields, football and cricket ovals, public
buildings such as libraries, large parks and water bodies. Where the
boundaries are open space, they contribute to cooling of surrounding
residential areas.

A pattern for a great variety of subcultures in a city is not a pattern
to form ghettos; rather it is a pattern of opportunity, allowing a city
to contain a multitude of different ways of life with comfortable
intensity. A rich mix of subcultures will not be possible if each
subculture is being inhibited by pressure from its neighbours.

/The subcultures are ideally defined by *shared land*, which is not
residential land, and which should be afforded as generous an area as
possible./

*** Pattern Conditions

*Enablers:*

- Subcultural Boundaries as public commons.
- Natural boundaries can be areas like local bushland, creeks, streams
  and rural fingers.
- Artificial boundaries can include ring roads, industrial ribbons,
  infrastructure, although they lack the potential to be ecotonal.

*Constraints:*

- State & Local Government planning that does not encourage fine grain
  zoning.

*** About this pattern
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-17
    :END:
Selecting shade trees need to be considered in accordance with the
*broadscale context* and associated site dynamics related to the
*detailed qualities of individual trees*.

*Broadscale context*: trees grown in groves, rows and shelterbelts (see
the pattern ESTABLISHING SITE FORESTS) have important microflora that
connect all trees through fungal hyphae in the soil. Care must therefore
be taken of root systems under canopy.

*Details of individual tree species* include canopy types and tree
shapes. Canopy shape determines the most effective shading.

*Suitable Round-topped trees*

- Evergreen (native)
- Brush Box; Moreton Bay fig; Bunya pine (Araucaria Bidwillii);
  Tallowwood (Euc microcorys); Plum pine (Podocarpus elatus).
- Deciduous (exotic)
- Plane tree; English oak.

*Suitable Horizontal Canopy Trees*

- Evergreen 
- River red gum (Euc camaldulensis); Spotted gum (Corymbia maculata);
  Mugga Ironbark (Euc sideroxylon); Lacebark (Brachychiton discolor).
- Deciduous
- Golden rain tree (Kolreuteria paniculata); Jacaranda (Jacaranda
  mimosifolia); Chinese Tallowwood (Sapium).

*Suitable Pyramidal Tree*

- Evergreen 
- River She-oak (Casuarina cunninghamiana); NZ Kauri (Agathis
  Australis);
- Silky oak (Grevillea robusta); Turpentine (Syncarpia glomulifera)
- Deciduous
- Golden cypress (Cupressus macrocarpa); Golden Lawson cypress
  (Chamaecyparis Sp); Deodar Cedar (Cedrus deodara).

*Suitable Open Canopy Tree*

- Evergreen 
- Lemon-scented gum (Corymbia citriodora); Scribbly gum (Euc haemastoma;
  Narrow-leafed ironbark (Euc crebra); Smooth-barked apple (Angophora
  costata); Cotton tree Hibiscus (Hibiscus tiliaceus);
- Narrow-leafed paperbark (Melaleuca linariifolia).

The *quality of Shade* depends on trees' attributes including leaf area;
high branching density; multiple canopy layers; canopy transmissivity;
canopy size and projection; canopy ventilation.

*Size Matters:* One strategically placed large tree has more impact on
an urban heat island than same quantity of smaller trees. The bigger
the tree the greater the benefits (see the pattern STREET TREES & PLAZA
TREES).

*Siting*

Shade trees in public open space can be situated beside paths, around
gathering spaces and can shade play equipment, as long as they have deep
soil and have minimal intrusion into crown projection.

*How much soil does a tree need? **

Small trees ( under 7 metres in height) need 36m^{3} ; medium trees
(between 7 --15 metres) need 38m^{3} ; large trees (above 15 metres)
need 39m^{3}. Studies in the US and Canada indicated that most critical
soil volumes fit into the 2 cubic feet/ per ft2 of crown projection,
although the observation is general and not a hard and fast rule (see
Grabosky, Bassuk & Trowbridge, 2002).

*Dripline and Structural Root Zone* For stability, tree roots must be
protected within the dripline of the canopy (the Tree Protection Zone or
TPZ) as well in the Structural Root Zone (SRZ) around the base of the
tree.

*** Pattern Conditions
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-17

*** About this pattern
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-18
    :END:
Keyline Planning manages the existing landscape through enhancing soil
quality, carbon capture and water holding capacity. Water naturally
flows downhill running off ridges and concentrating in valleys. The
basic site analysis for a keyline design includes identifying the ʻmain
ridgeʼ (the watershed divide), ʻprimary ridgesʼ (convex slopes radiating
off of the main ridge) and ʻprimary valleysʼ (concave basins receiving
runoff between primary ridges). The ʻkeypointʼ is where the slope
changes from convex to concave in shape and exists in valleys. It marks
the highest point in the landscape to hold water.

The contour passing through the keypoint is known as the ʻKeylineʼ.
Subsoil ploughing along the keyline decompacts degraded soils, improving
water infiltration, and distributing water more evenly. Subsoil plough
regime helps restore a soil's structure and water holding capacity. The
keyline subsoil rips create mini drainage channels diverting water
gently downhill and back out onto the ridges.

*This system uses the natural patterns of the landscape to catch and
store water for use in cooling strategies.*

*** Pattern Conditions
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-18
    :END:
*Enablers:*

- Keyline Planning enables the rapid development of biologically active,
  fertile soil within a systematically planned landscape. During an
  average three-year conversion phase, four to six inches of new topsoil
  are typically formed each year. This new topsoil stores large
  quantities of water in the landscape.
- Run-off water, stored in small dams, can later be released for rapid,
  gravity-powered flood-irrigation.
- Roads, forests, buildings and fencing that follow primary water layout
  and fit together within the lay of the land.
- Keyline Planning enables a permanent landscape where infrastructure
  components help to passively ensure the maintenance and renewal of the
  topsoil within it.

*Constraints:*

- Existing trees constrain where land modelling and contour ploughing
  can take place.
- Endangered Ecological Communities will constrain layout.

*** Commoning Concerns
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-18
    :END:
*Access:* People are unrestrained; restriction for vehicles.

*Use:* Open space recreation, channelling cool breezes.

*Benefit:* Improve & maintain soil quality, water management and carbon
storage.

*Care:* Local Government and community of commoners.

    :END:
Bushcare groups have nearly forty years of history in Sydney and greater
New South Wales. They use volunteer effort to engage in in a variety of
activities that benefit the local environment including tree planting,
bush regeneration, water quality monitoring, monitoring of wildlife
populations and community education. They provide a means to guard
against invasive species that can threaten biodiversity in the Bushland
habitat. Bush care in this way resembles other volunteer-based
organisations elsewhere in the world such as those in the US that
preserve riparian environments (river keepers). In the US, the efforts
of volunteer-based organisations have played a key role in conservation
monitoring and their oversight has made national legislation like the
Clean Water act so effective.

*** Pattern Conditions
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-19
    :END:
*Enablers*

- In Bushcare's long history, organisations such as the Australian
  Association of Bush Regenerators have developed a number of accessible
  resources that help local chapters to identify invasive species, and
  to monitor and maintain local habitats more effectively.

*Constraints*

- Some invasive species may be so well established that their
  eradication/management may prove to be impossible or their elimination
  may have unintended consequences.

*** Commoning Concerns

*Bush Care* as social and biophysical commons

*Ownership:* Voluntary organisation

*Access:* Open membership

*Use:* Ecological monitoring, ecological restoration, conviviality

*Benefit:* Human and non-human communities

*Care:* Voluntary organisation

Bushcare has evolved as an inclusive practice of caring for country. As
a consequence, it extends the terms of commoning and common-community to
human and non-human species. The patterns of colonial settler society
having wittingly and unwittingly introduced many species. While some
have had devastating consequences for the local environment, others have
become parts of varied human and non-human livelihoods; for example, the
role of wild-invasive goats in rural livelihoods and in the management
of other invasive plant species through their grazing habits. The
management of plant and animals nowadays as part of country is an
ongoing process of negotiation.

    :END:
A key to producing place-based coolth will be a community of commoners
who are prepared to initiate action and maintain the social and physical
infrastructure that supports this action. Such a group will need a mode
of organization and governance that is suited to this task. This could
take the form of a registered non-profit organisation/ governing body,
set up by elected representatives from within the residential community.
In general, this body is voluntary, it enjoys autonomy and it does not
have statutory powers over ownership, tenancy and so on.

This form of community governance will enable the concerns of the
residential neighbourhood or community/ housing complex to be addressed.
These concerns can include:

1. Management, maintenance and upkeep of common areas and facilities,
   including other cool commons.
2. Communication about cool places and cool/shaded times for different
   locations in the local area throughout the year.
3. Individual initiatives such as recycling, composting, community
   gardens, pedestrian infrastructure, shared playgrounds, upgrading of
   parks, signage and so on.
4. Orientation and spreading awareness of neighbourhood concerns within
   the membership, and connecting the neighbourhood to local governance
   mechanisms.
5. Arranging regular meetings, gatherings, cultural events, fundraising
   and so on.
6. Connecting with other community organizations concerned with local
   amenity, for instance Bushcare groups, service associations,
   churches, mosques or temples.

More broadly, community governance can be integrated with strategic
activities like a social enterprise lab where ideas are pitched for new
ways to sustainably enhance commoning and to put new ideas into the
public domain, or activities to promote the membership of other
community-led groups -- The Seniors Hub in Waverton NSW for instance
provides a good hybrid model for interests groups, it assists with aging
in place run and is by volunteers but supported by the local council
(see references and resources).

*** Pattern Conditions
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-20
    :END:
*Enablers*

- Community members who are already active, are usually a place to start
  with putting community governance in place.
- Community building techniques such as Asset Based Community
  Development have stood the test of time as a means by which
  communities can identify success and build on their strengths; these
  kind of practices can be useful for healthy and productive community
  governance processes.

*Constraints*

- Ongoing process of engagement require sustained interest and
  leadership from within the local community.
- Getting participation from a broad range of diverse residents.
- Handover process and succession patterns have to be clearly identified
  and set up.

*** Commoning Concerns
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-20
    :END:
*Community governance* as a mechanism for commoning practice

*Ownership:* non-profit or public ownership

*Access:* Free access to all meetings and programmes, but
decision-making power may rest with elected representatives

*Use:* Community benefit decisions and activities

*Responsibility:*

*Benefit:* provide ongoing, adaptive solutions to community living

*Care:* Residents' community

Community governance organisations needs to involve constant efforts to
strengthen practices and inclusiveness. This is because governance is a
lived (and not static) phenomena. If governance is not strengthening, it
is likely that it will be weakening.

*** About this pattern
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-21
    :END:
Post-occupancy studies are protocols for evaluating the technical
performance of (called post-occupancy analysis) and/or social
satisfaction with (called post-occupancy evaluation) single or
multi-residential buildings /after/ residents have moved in. This
pattern seeks to extend current post-occupancy studies to emphasise the
importance of learning from the experiences and practices of a community
of residents. Such ongoing learning is critically important if the aim
is to create liveable and sustainable places, as it could validate
goals, help identify and address emerging issues and opportunities, and
feed back into planning processes as a form of ‘continuous improvement'
and lifecycle planning.

Post-occupancy learning requires community engagement and outputs that
can form a durable record of a living place to inform learning over
time. This approach foregrounds and validates community expertise in the
lived context, which is under-represented in the literature about
liveability. Community stakeholders may initiate engagement around a
particular common concern, on a one-off or regular basis. Concerns might
be explored via regular resident walking meetings, workshops or social
‘living labs'. Mechanisms to ‘carry over' learning to improve the
planning and development process needs to be created, with precedents
existing in the form of collaborative governance arrangements (see
Report). Post-occupancy learning could facilitate enhanced openness and
trust and enable community-led innovation in planning and development
processes. It could also prime communities to explore the transition to
new practices, for example energy sharing, or new forms of water or
waste management. Citizen science projects recording local weather and
aspects of environmental change are a form of post-occupancy learning.
Retaining collected data in a local library (in addition to handing it
over to the investigating body [e.g. Australian Museum or Bureau of
Meteorology]) would enable future generations of residents to access
this data and facilitate intergenerational place-based learning. Adopt a
tree programs, where residents ‘adopt' a young local tree planted by
council and take responsibility for monitoring its health as it grows,
is another example. In this case, succession planning is important,
including mechanisms for intergenerational communication.

*** Pattern Conditions
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-21
    :END:
*Enablers:*

- Commitments to stakeholder engagement (e.g. Landcom's ‘Join-in
  Charter').
- Engagement Evaluation and Stakeholder Risk Framework.
- Resident surveys (e.g. Healthy and Inclusive Places Survey) currently
  captures ‘satisfaction' but not learning.
- Leveraging interest in citizen science for fine grain environmental
  monitoring.

*Constraints:*

- Scope limitations due to time constraints.
- Limitation of access to and facility with digital tools.
- Existing approaches to community engagement oriented to: project
  delivery; forward planning/ ‘visioning'; short-term and front-end
  engagement events. Conversely, post-occupancy learning is about lived
  experience.
- Access to tools to measure and capture information, experiences and
  practices will need to be managed.
- Legitimate pathways to loop post-occupancy learning back into project
  planning, will need to be developed.

*** Commoning Concerns
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-21
    :END:
*Access:* Residents and relevant stakeholders. The inclusion of newly
arrived residents will need to be facilitated.\\
/Use:/ Residents, future-residents, community liaison officer and other
development agency stakeholders.

*Benefit:* Community and development agency processes; potentially
external partners.

*Care:* Community-led studies might require agreements to monitor on an
ongoing basis; knowledge commons could be housed in community library.

*Responsibility:* Development agency liaison, community of residents,
library workers.

*Ownership:* Knowledge commons produced by engagement processes -- who
owns this, who has access and where is it housed, will need to be
decided.

Context information and site history -- who has access and where is this
housed?

Examples:

- a study monitoring bird and insect life in the residential development
- a study capturing and recording surface heat measures
- a workshop to capture commoning concerns (could be a social living
  lab)

What and how experiences and practices are captured, and where and how
outputs are stored, are key commoning concerns.

Some members of the community may find the process ‘nosy'. This would
need to be sensitively addressed.

A key commoning concern will be accessibility to tools to measure and
capture information, experiences and practices.

*** About this pattern
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-22
    :END:
Shuttle buses offer free or low-cost transportation between main
destinations (for instance between transit hubs and university or
corporate campuses or to specific venues such as museums, shopping
centres or swimming pools). They complement and address shortfalls in
other forms of mass transit such as trains or buses that cover greater
distances along specific routes.

Shuttle bus services of this sort can be provided directly by the
municipality. The Santa Barbara electric shuttle bus, for instance, runs
from the edge of the city district to the downtown areas and to numerous
destinations along the waterfront. The electric bus service is an
important component of the Innovative Clean Transit Standards being
adopted by the California Air Resources Board (Sustainable Bus n.d.). In
Parramatta, The Shuttle is a free transport solution run by Transport
for NSW through the Transdev mobility company, running seven days a
week, that connects tourists, residents and commuters to commercial,
retail and recreational landmarks. Alternatively, shuttle buses can be
wholly or partially subsidized by the benefiting institution (for
instance shuttles that cater to university students and staff).

*** Pattern Conditions
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-22
    :END:
*Enablers*

- Rapid transit by shuttle bus is enabled by bus lanes. The use of a
  shuttle bus is enabled by infrastructure that ties it into other
  transit infrastructure such as rail, light rail or ferries, in
  particular designated stop points that incorporate shade and/or
  shelter.
- Municipal policies for clean air and reduced congestion can encourage
  the formulation of shuttle bus services and local business that
  benefits from reduced congestion and better customer footfall might
  also be enrolled as sponsors.
- Websites or mobile phone applications are a good way to enhance the
  use and awareness of a shuttle bus service.

*Constraints*

- Buses require significant outlays of capital to purchase and maintain.
  This can make a free service hard to sustain, especially when hitting
  other targets, such as net zero emissions, necessitates upgrades. The
  Santa Barbara electric shuttle was free, but nowadays riders pay 50
  cents per ride, or buy a day pass for one dollar (Santa Barbara Car
  Free n.d.); the service is cheap but not entirely free, signifying
  tension in the enactment of a commons.
- Given the expense providers may also operate only during the hours
  that benefit a sponsoring organisation (such as Universities) and they
  may not cater to the needs of a whole population.

*** Commoning Concerns
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-22
    :END:
*Destination shuttle* as social commons/transit.

*Ownership:* Various (municipality, university or another sponsoring
organisation).

*Access:* Open to commuters (particularly those bound for particular
destination)

*Use:* Commuters using the service.

*Benefit:* Reduced fossil fuel emissions, reduced congestion, socially
inclusive transport.

*Care:* Municipality, University, Body Corporate, other.

Destination shuttles work effectively in connection with other forms of
mass transportation. They solve the last kilometre problem in getting to
and from major destination such as universities, shopping centres and
conference centres, and benefit a larger public by reducing congestion.
A major concern is that they tend to be site specific forms of transit
that do not directly benefit the public at large. This can lead to
ongoing negotiations over who maintains/pay for these services and how
much the public can be expected to support a transit form that only
benefits a subset of the population.

*** About this pattern
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-23
    :END:
‘Cool commons' are spaces and places that offer cooler temperatures than
surrounding areas. This pattern is concerned with how patchworks of
places/spaces can provide more accessibility.

Patchwork for accessible coolth is a pattern of scattered spaces, forms
or services accessible to pedestrians; it is low-rise and integrated
within neighbourhoods, enabling a /spectrum/ of fine differentiation.
This pattern suggests an alternative to continuous blocks of
development, or enclosed shopping centres.

Examples of built form and space types that could be patchworked
include:

- Patchwork green in a city
- Patchwork of social corners
- Cooling refuges
- Aged care
- Pocket parks
- Water play
- Shops

The accessibility of these places/spaces relates to the way people move
through them comfortably and how they know where they are going.
Patchwork analyses look at the fine grain, working closely with the
diverse ways people use urban space. Three ways of considering
patchworks (permeability & legibility; movement and responsive
environments) are offered here.

*Accessibility equals permeability & legibility*

*/Permeability/* is both physical and visual in the way it allows people
to pass through; it entails both private and public interfaces and
provides variety in the choice of movement. */Legibility/* exists where
the places/spaces have understandable forms such as edges, nodes, paths,
districts and landmarks (see Lynch 1960).

*Movement through patchwork* involves a kind of serial vision, whereby
elements of an environment -- buildings, trees, nature, water -- can be
interwoven in such a way that causes anticipation to occur (see
Cullen 1961)*.* We experience places in sequence, as the existing view
and the emerging view simultaneously. Examples of these spaces are;

- Enclaves, enclosure;
- Focal points, precincts; /hereness/ and /thereness/;
- Silhouette, incident;
- Undulation, fluctuation;
- Recession, anticipation, mystery.

*Responsive Environments* provide users with a democratic setting,
enriched by the degree of choice available (see Bentley et al 1985).
Criteria for evaluating responsive places include:

- Permeability: where people can go;
- Variety: the range of uses a place can have;
- Legibility: how people understand the place;
- Robustness: how people can use a place for different purposes;
- Visual appropriateness: the visual codes;
- Richness or the choice of sensory experiences;
- Personalization: people put their own stamp on places.

*** Pattern Conditions
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-23
    :END:
/*Enablers*/

- Planning codes that prevent amalgamated sites, control density,
  maintain diversity of use.
- Open space guidelines which designate the sizes of infill parks based
  on standard recreational uses.
- Strategies that favour urban walkability, like
  [[https://www.cityofparramatta.nsw.gov.au/sites/council/files/inline-files/Parramatta%20Ways%20Report_0.pdf][Parramatta
  Ways]] or reimagine city roads as pedestrian linkages.

/*Disablers*/

- Patterns of planning that favour densification and centralisation of
  services.

*** Commoning Concerns
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-23
    :END:
Various elements in these patchworks code the commons that are used by,
and are accessible to, a community of commoners who, to some degree,
care for, take responsibility for, and benefit from this coolness.

*Ownership:* Private/public ownership.

*Access:* Unrestricted.

*** About this pattern
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-24
    :END:
It is possible to manipulate the shape of a site to create sheltered
cool pockets and areas for respite or pathways.

Cool slopes are commons that provide coolth for people walking or
running through a community or seeking respite around the community.
They would typically have the greatest benefit either side of midday.
Open space that slopes to creeks or lakes is ideal for the insertion of
cool features such as cool banks, shade trees, grass mounds and paths*.*

To create these cool commons, site planning should map the
pre-development landform and slopes to take advantage of existing
contours; sun (e.g. southern sides), wind and rainfall patterns; soil
types and drainage.

This requires a fine grain analysis of site contours, so that the
existing site gets regraded to create these pockets of coolth where
practical. The resultant mounding can be used to contain services such
as underground rainwater storage tanks.

Successful application of this pattern will yield complete shade for
when the pocket is most commonly used.

*** Pattern Conditions
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-24
    :END:
*Enablers:*

- Local Environment Plans developed by local government require areas of
  open space for common recreational use.
- Integrating cool slopes, mounds or pockets within the ground modelling
  can add to the amenity. Innovative approaches can be explored in
  community workshops to enable civic participation in the design of
  cool slopes.

*Constraints:*

- Open space has to allow for multiple recreation uses. Open space
  planning often allocates flat land, so playing fields become the
  dominant use. This precludes ground remodelling in an open space
  context.
- Mounding will have to be created with consideration of ecological and
  hydrological impacts.

*** Commoning Concerns
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-24
    :END:
*Access:* High consideration of accessibility for all abilities should
be considered when applying cool slopes, and wherever possible the
principles of Universal Design applied.

*Use:* Passive recreation, integration into play spaces, urban design
features, active transport pathways.

*Benefit:* Increased amenity in public open space and improved
walkability due to increased shade and cooler spaces.

*Care:* Minimal care would be required by the community as the
landowners would likely maintain this common as part of the broader open
space maintenance.//

*Responsibility:* The landowner would have ultimate responsibility, but
the community would be required to use the common in a responsible
manner.

*Ownership:* Local government, development agency.

Staging of construction activities at strategic locations may be
required to sustain access to cool commons through the development
process and beyond.

    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-25
    :END:
Innovative cropping and consolidating measures to mitigate the impacts
of loss of agricultural land and its associated natural systems on
account of sprawling urbanisation, that results in the heating of urban
space. This is exacerbated by the growing impact of motor transportation
and related infrastructure on global warming. The appropriate pattern
relates to topography, soils and hydrology where urban development is
located on higher land and where agricultural land is located on the
lower slopes and floodplains beside creeks and rivers.

To achieve urban & rural fingers, there are several issues to address.

*Equity Issues* necessitate innovative planning that allows owners to
realise their land's development value without changing the rural use.
This can be achieved through transfer of development rights (TDR).

*New Farming Practice*: Maintaining rural and peri-urban fingers
requires making productive land attractive to new farmers. The market
growth of water products, ecosystem services, and niche marketing of
gourmet products are emerging opportunities for rural economics inspired
by new poly-cropping techniques.

*New Forms of Rural Living*: European planners offer alternative models
for ‘Rural Living' that allow for continued productive farming to be
associated with new clustered residential areas. This involves
innovative land tenure and inventive forms of governance that are drawn
from organizational strategies associated with cooperatives.

*New Urban Agriculture:* New urban agriculture associated with hybrid
urban formulas that conflate architecture, landscape, infrastructure and
high-tech farming, can instigate innovative forms of agriculture at the
urban rural nexus.

*** About this pattern
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-26
    :END:
Misting devices can be highly effective in cooling outdoor spaces. Dry
misting has been used extensively in public open space in Keyaki, Japan
and now in Toronto, Canada. Misting installations can also provide
attractive, interesting features into public spaces including
renovations of public parks, helping to increase their use. In some
instances, municipal authorities can commission misting devices and
misting fans as permanent or temporary art installations, which help to
generate higher footfall for local restaurants and retail businesses
(Roe, n.d.)

Although seemingly a misnomer, ‘dry mist' is formed when water is pushed
through a fine aperture at high pressure; the mist is so fine it
evaporates, feeling dry, and lowers the temperature by up to 30°F.
Misting fans are energy and water efficient, readily available and
easily installed. Depending on the types and placement of plants,
misting systems can double as watering systems, keeping plants lush and
green.

*Misting Pumps*

The most expensive part of the system is the high-pressure pump because
fine water droplets required for quick evaporation cannot be achieved by
low water pressure. Solar panels can supply the energy needed.

When installed and used properly, mist cooling systems can reduce
temperatures by as much as 30°F depending on the efficiency of the
misting system, relative humidity, and outdoor temperature. Evaporative
cooling is remarkably energy andwaterefficient.

*Misting devices cannot use stored on-site wate*r. The misting nozzle
requires mains water in order to ensure there is no particulate matter
to block it. There are also public health considerations if stored tank
or run-off water is used for misting.

*** Pattern Conditions
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-26
    :END:
*Enablers:*

- Misting devices are relatively inexpensive and can be deployed
  temporarily in public spaces, allowing seasonal use and reassignment
  to other spaces.//

*Constraints:*

- Governance is required when used in public open space. There are some
  health implications.
- May not be effective in areas of high humidity.

*** Commoning Concerns
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-26
    :END:
Misting devices facilitate the coolth for ‘cool commons'; those spaces
that offer cooler temperatures than surrounding areas and that are used
by, and are accessible to, a community of commoners who, to some degree,
care for, take responsibility for, and benefit from this coolness.

*Access:* Unrestricted and restricted.

*Use:* Outdoor recreation in reduced temperatures.//

*Benefit:* Cool outdoor space.

*Care:* Local Government, Body Corporate, community.

*Responsibility:* Local Government and Body Corporate.

*Ownership:* Community groups, Body Corporate, sometimes Local
Authorities.

*** About this pattern
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-27
    :END:
Parks and other public spaces can be important cool commons in the
evenings, when the heat of the day starts to dissipate from the public
domain and when it becomes cooler outside than in the home. Well-known
examples of night-time commons include night markets, festivals and
outdoor film screenings, all of which tend to be concentrated in urban
centres. As our summers get longer and hotter, the principle of the
night-time commons needs to be adopted more widely in an overall
strategy of rethinking how we use our local environments.

This pattern explores night-time commoning as a cooling strategy. An
important infrastructure that can be activated as night-time commons are
public parks and swimming pools. These environments are already cool
commons, but they tend to close in the evenings, precisely at the time
when they could best serve the community by providing a venue for
socialising, swimming, dining or other community gatherings on a hot
night.

Place-appropriate and engaging lighting is an important element in an
overall cultural shift toward night-time commoning. It is an attractor
for alternative park uses, to create ambience and promote safe
wayfinding and play. An example is the /Gates of Light/ art
installation at Macarthur Heights, a park designed for stargazing. In
addition to lighting, the activation of night-time commons are most
successful when they provide signage, other communications and
activation events to legitimise use and raise awareness amongst the
local community of the opportunities to use these spaces at night. This
is important as unlike in Australia's regional neighbours, night-time
commoning is unusual in Australia. This is where examples such as night
markets, dance and exercise, or community cookouts, can provide
inspiration for activating parks at night.

Kevin Lynch's urban design principles cited in Dufner et al.'s (nd)
night lighting study, focus on how people move through and experience
the city.

Measures of success for night-time commons are minimised incidents
relating to safety, minimised disruption to neighbours and maximised
attendance.

*** Pattern Conditions
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-27
    :END:
*Enablers*

- Increasing urban heat and the dangers of UV radiation (the Cancer
  Council for example recommends staying out of the sun between 11am and
  3pm) create a need to explore the use of outdoor public spaces at
  cooler times of the day.
- Night lighting, as well as provision of public drinking water and
  public amenities, are important supportive infrastructures.

*Constraints*

- A challenge for night-time commoning might be that features of the day
  park, such as permanent shelter and shade fixtures, could create
  safety and visibility issues, and inhibit some night-time uses, such
  as star gazing.
- The impact of noise on surrounding residential neighbourhoods may also
  need to be addressed.

*** Commoning Concerns
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-27
    :END:
*Access:* The space used for this common is accessible in the same way
that it would be during the daytime and by the same people.

*Use:* Technical management could be entrusted by local government to a
community of commoners if the use is different to the typical daytime
use.

*Benefit:* The night-time commons provides cool spots in open space to
those people who have free time during the evenings.

*Care:* The site is maintained per the standard daytime program,
however, the commoning community and any contractors (i.e. cinema, food
trucks etc.) must manage additional wear and tear to the common.

*Responsibility:* The common is governed by the asset or landowner and
the commoning community would need to regulate their own behaviour and
safety.

*Ownership:* The ownership does not change from the daytime structure.

A commoning concern related to the socially-activated night time space
could be managing noise for surrounding residents not using the park
(for example shift workers). If use involves cooking, this could also
mean issues with smells. This might be ameliorated by designing
dedicated events for quieter usage or determining times for noisier
events like dancing, markets or films by a community scheduling tool or
poll. Night-time commons need to be designed co-operatively with the
communities who will use them in order to address these commoning
concerns.

*** About this pattern
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-28
    :END:
Signage of all kinds, physical and digital provides an important
orienting and way finding role in public life, thus supporting ways of
commoning. Signage can be a temporary measure to provide an induction
into the careful and appropriate use of a place, or to tell stories in
order to enrich the experience of a place. Signs can also work in the
other way as forms of punitive resistance to commoning, such as
declaring private zones in an otherwise open /continuous environment,
amplifying risks and dangers, or rendering place-based social practices
illegal, such as congregating, fishing, walking, picnicking, climbing,
camping and bird feeding.

*** Pattern Conditions
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-28
    :END:
*Enablers*

- City of Sydney regulations make mixed provisions that can support
  commoning for a short-term period. “While commercial bill posters are
  illegal, signage posted by community members to advertise garage
  sales, find missing pets or to promote local fetes are not in breach
  of these laws.” However, there is a one-week limit.

*Constraints*

- State Environmental Planning Policy regulates signage and provides
  time-limited consents.
- Risk management protocols favour signs that amplify risks and deter
  use.
- Signage can be visually unappealing and can seem to stand in for poor
  design.
- Signage can be easy to ignore.
- Physical signage can disrupt airflow and be a hazard in high wind.

*** Commoning Concerns
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-28
    :END:
*Access:* Those who can see and understand the sign.

*Use:* Resident community, visitors.

*Benefit:* Resident community, visitors, potentially animals and
habitats, distributions of material resources .

*Care:* Depending on the nature of the sign, care could fall to Local
Government Authority, resident community or both.

*Responsibility:* All users, Local Government Authority.

*Ownership:* Depending on the nature of the sign, owners could be Local
Government Authority, resident community or both.

A commoning concern is digital accessibility to support online signage
through digital maps, apps and wayfinding tools.

The language and tone of voice with which a sign speaks can have an
impact on accessibility. Signage is a limited measure that needs to be
supported by social evidence -- for example people using a space
quietly will be more influential than a sign saying ‘quiet zone';
equally a ‘no swimming' sign will be overridden by people swimming in a
water fountain. This raises a question regarding signs: not what agency
does the sign have, but rather /when/ does a sign have agency?

*** About this pattern
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-29
    :END:
A designated walkway between two activity spaces that is marked by shady
trees planted close enough to provide a cool corridor around a paved or
unpaved footpath. The trees and walkway are meant to communicate across
generations the importance of memory, and care for an event or people or
something.

Along the walkway there are benches for rest and reflection. There could
be commemorative plaques in the paving. Shrubs or flowers that are of
particular significance to who or whatever is being commemorated can be
planted between the trees.

Memorial walkways that commemorate those killed in war are common around
Australia. But shaded walkways could be built as part of a community
building exercise to commemorate other events, people or species. 

*Planning note:* As trees will take some years to grow to a size that
provides shade, community involvement needs to be backed up with care by
a continuous authority such as a council.

*** Pattern Conditions
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-29
    :END:
*Enablers*

- Walkway location to be identified at planning stage.
- Identify a route connecting activity spaces that are frequently used.
- A walkway capable of being used by walkers, tricycles, wheelchairs and
  low traffic bikers.
- New residents are invited to participate in deciding what the Memorial
  Walk will commemorate, as part of a community building exercise.
- An annual event that remembers what the walkway is for and invites
  other new community members to join in the commemoration.
- Trees are selected for shade and longevity.
- Planting of trees to be a community event coordinated by a local
  association or Municipality.

*Constraints*

- Maintaining care of the trees during the establishment stage.
- Maintaining a connection to a community of rememberers.

*** Commoning Concerns
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-29
    :END:
Planning and establishing a Memorial Walk is a commoning intervention
that has the /potential/ to call forth a community of commoners (people
who initiate and care for a commons). Generating interest in ‘leaving a
mark' and communicating across generations will take time and commitment
by a community development agent working with new residents.

*Access:* All residents, visitors, birds, animals.

*Use:* All residents, visitors, birds, animals.

*Care:* Of trees performed by Local Government Authority (LGA), of
commemorative plaques performed by commoning community in partnership
with LGA.

*Benefit:* Atmosphere, coolth, shade, rest spaces, community
connections.

*Responsibility:* Commoning community who have identified what will be
commemorated.

*Ownership:* Publically owned open space; trees ‘owned' by LGA.

*** About this pattern
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-30
    :END:
Establishing site forests is a critical practice to engage communities
in planting and caring for trees, and to enable coolth for future
generations.

**/Locating Contour Strip Forests/*

Broadscale site forests are best located after a Keyline analysis has
located the Keyline. In primary valleys, cultivation of strips/bands for
tree planting takes place below the Keyline contour. On primary ridges,
cultivated strips/bands lie parallel and above the Keyline. Trees can
also border roads above irrigation channels. Trees should be planted in
Riparian corridors and planted surrounding water bodies.

***/Preparation and planting/*

A specialised Keyline plough should cultivate strips/bands 4 centimetres
below root depth, to aerate soil along contours. Trees should be planted
as tube stock to ensure successful and rapid growth. Biodegradable tree
guards and stakes are needed to facilitate moisture condensation and
protection against grazing.

****/Establishing Forests through Ecological Succession/*

Successional ecologies can be applied to forest management regimes in
urban environments: rather than humans being the primary maintenance
mechanism, we can start to use passive maintenance through environmental
manipulation and an understanding of succession; for example,
short-lived, fast-growing Acacia spp. species have been interplanted
with various eucalyptus species, to encourage a faster growth rate and
more upright form.***

*** Pattern Conditions
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-30
    :END:
*Enablers:*

- Existing trees may be part of remnant indigenous forests that can be
  integrated with new forests.
- Existing trees may be components of cultural heritage landscapes,
  which should be kept & interpreted.
- Successional planting can also be undertaken by communities.

*Constraints:*

- Rehabilitation of existing forests.
- Arboriculture assessments of existing trees.
- Conformity to Commonwealth EPBC Act (1999) & NSW Biodiversity
  Conservation Act (2016)
- Space to establish forests in urban areas is constrained by hard
  infrastructure and conventions of planting single trees in
  road-flanking rows.

*** About this pattern
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-31
    :END:
Pedestrian areas should be designed and created to maximise the use of
outdoor space and encourage active transport (walking, running, cycling)
around the local area. A network of active transport links to local
amenities including parks, shops and public transport should be designed
for safe shared use (i.e. concurrent walking and cycling). The fastest
and most accessible walking and cycling routes should be signposted so
that they are easy to find and navigate. There also needs to be a method
for people to report observed problems. Trees that provide dense shade
should be planted along pedestrian links so that it is comfortable for
people of diverse abilities to travel locally on foot or by other means.
Temporary shade structures should be used to provide shade while trees
grow. Accessible “infrastructures of care” including shelter, seating,
access to municipal drinking water and universal toilets are essential
to support pedestrians.

*** Pattern Conditions
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-31
    :END:
*Enablers:*

- Ensure that new developments do not break up transport links. Consider
  how public streets and transport links will be maintained over time,
  including maintaining shared footpaths, signage and shade cover.
- Clean signage indicating best and safest routes to key locations will
  encourage use and provide contact details and an invitation to people
  to care for the shared amenity by reporting problems.

*Constraints:*

- Limited amenities to support comfortable and safe mobility such as
  shade, drinking water and places to rest will limit use of public
  streets. Personal safety concerns may limit use.

*** Commoning Concerns
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-31
    :END:
Public street as commons

*Access:* Access for all, including people, personal mobility vehicles
(bicycles, strollers), animals (particularly dogs).

*Use:* For transiting the local neighbourhood, including between houses
and to nodes such as transport and local shops.

*Benefit:* Encourage active transport and discourage car use in the
local area; provide open space and shade for users.

*Care:* Local government will have formal responsibility; engaged local
communities will use transit spaces carefully and take part in reporting
issues and ongoing maintenance as required.

*Ownership:* Local government, except in the case of private roads.

Commoning concerns include the ways that users interact and negotiate
use of shared transport zones (for instance in shared cycling and
walking zones, pedestrian crossings and other places where active
transport and car users intersect). Traffic calming devices and clearly
signposted crossings make local streets safer and ensure that cars give
way to pedestrians.

The provision of shade can inhibit visibility, leading to perceptions
that a place may be unsafe. Encouraging collective walking will address
personal safety concerns, particularly at night.

*** About this pattern
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-32
    :END:
A heat preparedness plan is part of a commons-infrastructure that
enables community response to heat emergencies and helps to keep
vulnerable people safe at these times.

The Heat Preparedness Welcome Pack should include a heat emergency
preparedness guide that explains the available infrastructure showing
how to respond to heat events in this community. The pack should
identify cooling infrastructures and resources, and the chain of command
for activating a heat emergency and protocols for checking in with
neighbours. The ultimate aim of such a pack would be the creation of a
community-based governing body of stake holders that maintain this
commons-infrastructure.

*** Pattern Conditions
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-32
    :END:
*Enablers*

Occupational Health and Safety guideline can be consulted to ensure that
heat emergency preparedness conforms with existing protocols and
requirements.

NSW State Emergency Service and Rural Fire Service also have resources
to be consulted, as well as strategies for mobilising peer to peer
networks for emergency preparedness.

ABC news and websites and other social media outlets will also play
essential role in mobilising a response.

*Constraints*

In new communities, levels of trust may be low. Linguistic or cultural
barriers may limit the effectiveness of the heat preparedness guide or
the implementation of strategy.

*** Commoning Concerns
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-32

*Ownership:* Landcom/community.

*Access:* Open to all residents of community.

*Use:* Orients new residents to available resources and protocols for
dealing with a heat emergency.

*Benefit:* Community residents benefit through knowledge of available
resources and practices of mutual aid in face of a heat emergency.

*Care:* The initial duty of care lies with community liaison officer and
then with community themselves.

*** About this pattern
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-33
    :END:
Temporary or ‘meanwhile' use of outdoor public unused space or private
space earmarked for future development, can provide opportunities for
site activation which reduces urban heat island effect, through greening
activities or through providing public access to private cool spaces.
Examples include pop-up uses such as shops or markets that use cool
materials or urban gardens. Existing car parks or vacant lots can
provide a platform for improved local cooling, with interventions
reducing the amount of impermeable low albedo hardscape.

*Citizens as urban co-producers*

Precedents for occupying urban spaces with temporary projects include
the Paris-based Atelier d'Architecture Autogeree. Their “ECOboxes”
(pictured) are installed in different neighbourhoods as temporary
platforms for participatory gardening and a mix of other social and
cultural activities. Activities include workshops, talks, screenings,
preparing and sharing meals. Another example is R-Urban, which is a
network of closed local ecologies where participants only consume what
is produced. Temporary urban gardening can encourage local capacity
building and encourage new forms of collaborative governance. For
example, in Brisbane, a community negotiated the right to develop a yam
plantation (pictured) on unused land for a three-year period, agreeing
to cover all costs including relevant insurances. The whole community
was involved in the preparation, cultivation and harvesting of the crop
which was then distributed among the community and to charity groups.
When the land was needed by the governing institution, a new plantation
was created temporarily elsewhere (Armstrong, 2016, p. 72).

The measure of success for this pattern includes reducing the ambient
and surface temperature of unused land by increasing the quantum of
permeable or shaded surfaces; the longevity of the access negotiated to
maximise the temporary use, and the social and community return on
investment generated during the term.

This pattern does not include temporary use of buildings as Cooling
Refuges (see separate pattern).

*** Pattern Conditions
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-33
    :END:
*Enablers:*

- Landowners wanting to maintain asset values during the construction
  phase of staged precincts through activation and placemaking, with the
  ability to provide temporary use development applications (or similar)
  to facilitate meanwhile uses for a term period.
- Community liaison officers and community representatives can actively
  encourage citizens in their neighbourhood to initiate new activities,
  and function as brokers for temporary use.

*Constraints:*

- Temporary use implies collaborative governance arrangements, which may
  need to be negotiated if not already in place and can take time.
- Protocols for temporary use will need to be worked out by the partners
  involved, to establish procedures and divisions of responsibility.
  These protocols, like the spaces themselves, will need to be adaptable
  and open to renegotiation as circumstances change. A temporary use
  handbook, provided as part of a “welcome orientation”, would support
  residents to understand protocols.
- Temporary use equipment and resources will need to be stored and
  managed. This might involve negotiating arrangements with local
  businesses, the local library or community centre.
- Political and logistical challenges may emerge, should a community
  desire to transition from temporary to permanent use.

*** Commoning Concerns
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-33
    :END:
*Access:* Unrestricted access. The inclusion of newly arrived residents
will need to be facilitated, and the space should maximise opportunity
for Universal Design principles.

*Use:*The commoning community would negotiate any uses that facilitate
the reduction in surface and ambient temperature, while improving public
access to sites that are not being utilised or are currently
inaccessible.//

*Benefit:* Community capacity building; convivial sociality directed
into potentially positive new social practices.

*Care:* Community groups, body corporates, or other governance
mechanisms utilised. For this common, the landowner would likely not
provide any maintenance.

*Responsibility:* Community groups, body corporate, site visitors or
contractors engaged by the commoning community.

*Ownership:* Developers or local government.

For some members of a community, for example shift workers, noise might
be a commoning concern. A protocol of inclusiveness around planning
events that may impact on others could address this concern.

*** About this pattern
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-34
    :END:
Car shares are ways of sharing access to automobiles for a variety of
uses. They can be organised informally or among community members, but
the contemporary car shares make use of web-based platform technology to
grant access to vehicles that are either privately owned or owned by a
ride-share service such as Go-get. The City of Sydney, like cities
elsewhere, has allocated a portion of available street parking to car
share programs in order to ensure equitable access. Car share programs
can work to reduce car congestion, carbon emissions, and demand for
parking spaces by offering an alternative to private automobile
ownership.

*** Pattern Conditions
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-34
    :END:
*Enablers*

- Municipal approaches to management of parking resources can help
  facilitate use of ride sharing programs.
- Platform based technologies provide a way of coordinating ride shares,
  as well as assurance and regulatory oversight.
- Car sharing schemes work well in the city of Sydney where parking
  space is a limited resource, where there are several transportation
  alternatives and where school, work, shopping and other amenities are
  nearby.

*Constraints*

- Ride sharing can be cost prohibitive. Like other platform-based
  enterprises, the model can be wealth extractive and counter-productive
  to a commons.
- Long distances between home, work, school and shopping may discourage
  use of ride sharing services.

*** Commoning Concerns
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-34
    :END:
*Carshare* as social commons/transit

*Access:* Open to licenced drivers enrolled in ride sharing programs.

*Use:* Local transport; use in longer distance transit on trips where
cargo also needs to be carried.

*Benefit:* Reduced fossil fuel emissions, reduced congestion.

*Care:* Ride share coordinating body.

*Ownership:* Various forms of ownership of different
infrastructures/devices are involves (public or private ownership of
cars, platform technologies, and parking space).

Car sharing provides a way of replacing private ownership of automobiles
with shared use. While city dwellers benefit from an improved
atmospheric commons, and reduced demand upon public infrastructure,
questions remain around both the taxation and regulation of
platform-based enterprises.

*** About this pattern
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-35
    :END:
*Annual fêtes or fairs* can be fund-raising activities for any community
that help to foster stronger community identity and pride in
achievements.

*Street parties and fêtes* are ways to get to know neighbours and build
strong communities. They can be important ways to celebrate together.
Most Councils support neighbourhood gatherings as they foster community
spirit and good neighbour relations. A successful street party could be
as small and intimate as a few chairs in a front yard, up to a BBQ in
the local park, or a party in a local street.

*Temporary Structures*

If a tent, marquee or stall is erected, it requires local government
approval either as a public building under the /Health Act/ or as a
temporary building under Building Regulations. Local government may
waive this requirement for low risk structures. As a general rule if the
public are within or on the facility it should have local government
approval.

Temporary structures such as merchandise stalls, seating, food stalls
and so on must be erected and secured in accordance with the
manufacturers specifications to ensure they are structurally sound and
can withstand likely wind in the locality.

*/Sustainability Considerations/*

Some Councils have sustainability strategies and rules whereby events
need to reduce the use of plastic packaging and plastic cutlery and
crockery for the service of food, and to encourage recycling by stall
operators and patrons. The City of Sydney has a no balloons policy in
all of its parks and open spaces. Balloons are not be permitted for any
events.

*/General Considerations/*

- For residents/neighbours only; should be self-organised;
- No licence normally necessary if music is incidental and no alcohol is
  sold;
- Closure of residential roads only; apply for road closure at least 6
  weeks before the event.
- Public liability insurance optional but advisable/sensible; organisers
  must accept responsibility for possible claims if public liability
  insurance is not in place.
- If not formal risk assessment is in place, protocols for managing
  health or other emergencies are planned in advance.
- Considerations for night parties include ensuring appropriate
  visibility and notifying neighbours.

Event Clear Up; provide suitable waste receptacles and make arrangements
for litter picking and waste removal after the event.

*** Pattern Conditions
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-35
    :END:
*Enablers:*

- Local Governments support street parties in principle because they
  enhance social cohesion and contribute to a greater sense of trust and
  safety, and better health and well-being in the community.

*Constraints:*

- Mobile Food Facilities (MFF): For safety purposes, operators of MFFs
  are required to secure a health permit prior to operating. MFFs are
  usually restricted to */Pushcart/Ice Cream Cart/* distributing
  pre-packaged non-potentially hazardous foods only; no food preparation
  is permitted; For a */Hot Dog Cart/* limited food preparation is
  permissible but no complex food preparation; For a */Food Truck/* full
  service and food preparation is allowed within the enclosed vehicle.
  No food preparation is allowed outside the food truck (except for an
  outdoor barbeque).
- Risk assessments should consider: Slipping, tripping or falling
  hazards (e.g. loose carpets, unsecured cables); any vehicles driving
  onto site; electrical safety (e.g. use of any portable electrical
  appliances); poor lighting, heating or ventilation; storing and
  serving food (e.g. chilled items being left out of the fridge for too
  long); and any other hazards you may find.
- A fire risk assessment is a *legal requirement* -- the person
  responsible for the event must make a suitable and sufficient
  assessment of the risks.
- Noise Control at Small Outdoor Events: _Inform all affected people of
  the following_

1. The event (offer free tickets or invite people along);
2. Start and finish times;
3. The Complaint Hotline number if they want to make a complaint.

*** Commoning Concerns
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-35
    :END:
Common spaces can be used for temporary events, particularly if they
offer cooler temperatures than surrounding areas and if they are used
by, and are accessible to, a community of commoners who, to some degree,
care for, take responsibility for, and benefit from this coolness.

*Access:* Varies; outdoor markets have access for all; parties and
fund-raisers by invitation.

*Use:* Recreation, fund-raising.

*Benefit:* Community engagement, strengthening the use of common space.

*Care:* Event organisers and community.

*Responsibility:* Event organisers and community.

*Ownership:* Body Corporate, community.

A commoning concern will be negotiating road use: ensuring adequate
notice of road closure and legible signage to alert drivers. Another is
ensuring dogs are leashed to ensure safety.

    :END:
Community libraries can integrate multiple uses and forms of knowledge
at various scales and provide readily accessible interior and exterior
cool spaces. Community libraries provide free access to books,
audiovisual, and other materials to local residents who must be members;
some extend into lending household and other items as well such as
tools, toys, and cooking implements.

Libraries usually provide free internet access, although this may be
time-limited, and many provide charging ports for electronic devices.
Libraries can combine or balance indoor and outdoor spaces and include
bookable meeting and discussion rooms. Most libraries are used for
learning and other events such as classes or reading groups, whether
organised and run by library staff or other non-profit organisations.
Many libraries include cafes.

Libraries can provide free community cooling refuges during times of
extreme heat, provide early childhood and local health services, and
house a knowledge commons of and for the community.

*** Pattern Conditions
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-36
    :END:
*Enablers*

- Community buildings such as libraries can serve an important function
  as cool refuges in times of extreme heat (Bradford et. al. 2015).

*Constraints*

- Libraries require funds for construction and there is an imputed or
  actual cost of site allocation (if purpose built).
- The maintenance and management of libraries cost and effort; this
  requires trained and qualified professional staff.

*** Commoning Concerns
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-36
    :END:
Community libraries are a public commons.

*Ownership:* Community libraries are usually in public ownership and
most often owned by Local government. State and Federal levels of
government also provide large institutional libraries.

*Access:* Access is free and open to anyone. Joining the library bestows
rights such as borrowing and internet access.

*Use:* Libraries can be used for education, recreation, and life
management through internet access to online government services. They
also provide spaces for spontaneous interaction and, where the
infrastructure is conducive, spaces for interaction, meetings and
learning activities outside.

*Benefit:* Libraries provide immense benefit including learning, social
interaction, life management, community engagement and cool spaces.

*Care:* As public assets, libraries are cared for by paid staff who are
government employees, although users are also asked to respect the space
and the rights of other users.

    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-37
    :END:
Many development sites have remnant indigenous vegetation. It is
important to understand whether this vegetation is part of an Endangered
Ecological Community. In the Sydney region there are twelve
designated*endangered ecological forests*listed under
the*Commonwealth Government's Environment Protection and Biodiversity
Conservation Act 1999*(EPBC Act), of which six are critically
endangered. NSW Government also has a new*Biodiversity Conservation Act
2016*(BC Act). In the BC Act, threatened ecological communities are
defined by the NSW Threatened Species Scientific Committee. The BC Act
lists over 100 threatened ecological communities. All except four are
primarily made up of plant species.

A threatened ecological community is listed as either a “Vulnerable
Ecological Community”, “Endangered Ecological Community (EEC)” or
“Critically Endangered Ecological Community (CEEC)”. Maps of the
Communities are available
at[[http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publiclookupcommunities.pl]]

*Site Planning Stages*

Existing forests and woodlands on a site need to be mapped and tree
species identified. If it is a remnant stand of one of the EEC/CEEC,
then protective ribbons need to encircle it. The extent of the
particular EEC/CEEC can be verified through the NSW Dept of
Environment. An arboriculture assessment of tree health is then
required.

*Excavation, Hydrology, Drainage*

The hydrology of the area adjoining the trees, particularly upslope,
will need to be mapped. It is important that no earth works or changes
to site drainage occur within the vicinity of the trees.*Mature
Eucalypts & Angophoras are particularly susceptible to altered
drainage*.

*Endangered Ecological Forests in the Sydney Region*

- Blue Gum High Forest of the Sydney Basin Bioregion (CEEC)
- Castlereagh Scribbly Gum and Agnes Banks Woodlands of the Sydney Basin
  Bioregion (CEEC)
- Coastal Upland Swamps in the Sydney Basin Bioregion (EEC)

    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-38
    :END:
To control heat and humidity in a large park we need to map the paths of
cooling breezes as well as the areas where there are no breezes, and
then map the topography and porosity of the soil to determine where
water is most likely to collect (usually in the lowest lying areas).

This process will locate the most and least pleasant microclimates. We
can then discern where to locate devices to provide shade and clean air,
dehumidifiers to reduce moisture, fountains to lower ambient
temperatures and even ultrasonic speaker systems to drive away
mosquitos. These will make up a pattern of devices for the benefit and
comfort of the users of the park. They will reinforce areas that are
already made comfortable by reducing the heat and humidity through means
such as specific plants and trees chosen for their ability to shade
according to their canopy, or water fountains and atomisers to cool the
air.

According to the number of devices in a given area, the spaces are more
or less enjoyable, more or less comfortable. Such climatic devices can
be versions of park furniture such as benches, fountains, or sculptures.
Their role will be either as dehumidifiers, or as devices that cool
surfaces from underground pipes or that decrease the intensity of light
or create shade. In planning for the park, buildings can be located in
the most uncomfortable areas whereas recreational and leisure activities
can be situated in the most comfortable microclimates; that is, where
heat and the relative humidity level will be at a minimum. The lowest
lying parts of the park are likely to collect rainwater, and so generate
higher air humidity. This is where the dehumidifying devices should be
placed. Keeping in mind the relationship of the park to its topography
and the water that is collected, *keyline* sub-ploughing can be used to
slow down rainwater and enable it to infiltrate as closely as possible
the places where it falls into the superficial layers of soil.

*** About this pattern
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-39
    :END:
Multi-use community centres are spaces that are open to residents for a
variety of uses that can range from informal through to formal and
structured. These activities are usually free or provided on a
non-profit basis. The centre should be intimate but flexible enough to
suggest and enable a range of uses such as celebrations, meetings, and
classes.

Multi-use community centres should include a kitchen and toilets, be
accessible to people with diverse abilities, and be safe and inclusive
spaces. Flatt access routes and shaded areas for seating outside provide
inclusivity and coolth.

They can also include a range of indoor and outdoor spaces; teenagers
and young adults are often overlooked in planning, so they may need more
consideration as specific target users. Repurposed sales offices could
be used as multi-use community centres.

*** Pattern Conditions
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-39
    :END:
*Enablers*

- Public funds to support the management and/or the construction of
  facilities.
- Community support, fundraising and co-production related to
  construction and/or the management of facilities.

*Constraints*

- Current development patterns and processes do not readily generate
  sites or funds for the construction or management of multi-use
  community centres
- Current sales and occupancy processes do not generate a ready pool of
  potential community-based site managers

*** Commoning Concerns
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-39
    :END:
*Multi-use community centres* are a hybrid commons that mix ownership
and management of assets between institutions in different sectors and
which can combine non-profit principles with the principles of
enterprise.

*Access:* Free for residents and should be easy and universally
inclusive; events, activities, and classes may have a fee

*Use:* As per their name, multi-use community centres enable a range of
activities and provide spaces and opportunities for spontaneous
interaction.

*Benefit:* Multi-use community centres provide a social focal point that
enhances the identity of the community and possibly provide cool
interior and exterior spaces.

*Care:* When a non-profit organisation is the occupant, they are usually
responsible for care and maintenance. Casual users (e.g., for a birthday
party or meeting) are usually required to clean up after their event.

*Responsibility:* Often a local non-profit community organisation will
own or lease the centre, and/or be responsible for site maintenance and
management. Governance of facilities and policy decisions can involve
community members outside of the NPO sitting as board members in
addition to public officials.

*Ownership:* Private non-profit or public ownership.

*** About this pattern
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-pattern-40
    :END:
As trees grow to maturity, they change the microclimate around them.
Deciduous trees for instance will form a shady canopy during summer and
also provide shelter from hot winds, and then let the sun through in
winter (ABC 2009). Trees take time to mature into a size that can afford
shade and coolth, however, and they need to be protected to mature.
Furthermore, mature trees can die back or die altogether, thus other
trees need to be on their way towards maturity to take their place. It
is therefore imperative that senescent trees, that is, trees of advanced
old age or trees in decline, that are more susceptible to disease,
insect infestation and decay, are responsibly managed in urban streets
and parks and that succession tree planting is planned for (City of Ryde
2016, pp. 24-26). This particularly requires the development of
expertise relating to:

- Monitoring tree senescence patterns.
- Staggering plantings over time.
- Communicating clearly to park users the plans for staggered plantings,
  and the transformative processes currently taking place.

*** Pattern Conditions
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: pattern-conditions-40
    :END:
*Enablers*

- Some Local Government Authorities are coming to realise that unplanned
  work to remove and replace individual trees on an ad-hoc basis is
  overly expensive and that a better solution is to develop a Tree
  Master Plan for parks and precincts, together with a tree inventory
  and community consultation programme (with calls for volunteering).

*Constraints*

- Long term plans are difficult to envision, and changes can happen too
  slowly to be discerned sufficiently to inspire respect. Original plans
  might be lost over time if there are not activities that ensure
  intergenerational communication.
- Trees may not grow as planned for. Extreme weather events can disrupt
  long-term landscape designs.

*** Commoning Concerns
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: commoning-concerns-40
    :END:
*Tree planting as an activity among commoners* who create, sustain and
are sustained by the commons

*Ownership:* Local Government Authority.

*Access:* All public; birdlife.

*Use:* Better planning for tree replacement;

*Benefit:* Maintaining coolth in microclimates; amenity of public space;

*Care:* Local Government Authority; contracted arboriculturists;
community volunteers.**

Usually experts design and maintain landscapes. Users of the cooling
services of park landscapes can be invited into the process of planning
and assisting the realisation of landscape designs over time. Planting
for succession can create intergenerational sense of ownership over a
commons.

*Note:* We can also improve passive maintenance of vegetation through
environmental manipulation and an understanding of ecological
succession. In this way, non-human users are also enrolled into a
commoning ecosystem.
