#+title: Repeat Phase II
#+filetags: :OLD:

Reform groups, and run the exercises from Myths with a new
[[id:57d46961-a056-435e-85d2-27ab6e0de7f6][Historian]]. The new Historian should recap key points from the PAR from
the previous group’s Systems-to-Litany exercise, and the team should
then explore the new scenario, following all of the steps again.

This process can be repeated more than once as time allows. As you
work through this activity, feel free to introduce connections with
the previous scenario(s) you already explored, although the new
Historian won’t be familiar with them.
