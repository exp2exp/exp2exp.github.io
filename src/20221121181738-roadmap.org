#+title: Roadmap
#+filetags: :HL:WS:

* Summary

*Context* a group needs to coordinate its activities over a period of
time. *If* the landscape is complex and not completely knowable BUT
adjustment to action based on feedback is possible; *Then* use an
explicit mechanism to share information about goals, obstacles, methods,
and resources.

* Instructions

** Our Plan

- Recognise that we are living inside "Phase III"
- Make sure that we have things well prepared
- We do have a =yasnippet= based workflow for running the *meetings*, could we do something similar with the workflow for the *workshop*?
- Use a common agenda file for the Abby project; it will live somewhere we can all access & track tasks
