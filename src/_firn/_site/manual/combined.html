Over the next decade, AI could eat software engineering too. On the way to full-blown AI for programming, we can imagine an AI system that integrates with code editors, issue trackers, Slack, Github, and Stack Exchange — and that supports upskilling, productivity, and automation, all in one platform — significantly augmenting the ability of human programmers.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="the-time-is-now"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>The time is now.</span></span></h3><section><p><span>The basic research agenda was already set by Alan Turing in the late 1940s.  However, it is only recently that we have two necessary assets: massive amounts of relevant data, and the tools needed to process it into a usable form.  Code completion, code generation, and automated testing are already available to software developers.  They represent a variety of partial solutions that suggest that there’s something more substantial here.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="open-source-is-the-way-forward"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Open source is the way forward.</span></span></h3><section><p><span>Our team brings together applied experience in Natural Language Processing (NLP), computational modelling, reasoning, physics, biology, and statistics.  Having known each other for years, we have banded together around realising serious AI systems.  We see this as a revolutionary task.  Other institutes may be better funded, but our unique experience with building open source products is what’s needed to build a genuinely transformative community around this effort.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="the-steps-progress-from-data,-to-models,-to-ai-agents"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>The steps progress from data, to models, to AI agents.</span></span></h3><section><p><span>On this blog, we will document our progress.  Presently we are all working on this sub-part-time. Future posts in this series will expand the agenda outlined here, and provide tutorial material that can help turn readers into contributors.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Beginning from the data, we plan to use contemporary information extraction methods to derive computationally meaningful material from Stack Exchange Q&A, Github Issues, and programmers’ discussions, along with code. To do this, we will combine general purpose language models, like BERT, and a knowledge graph approach.</span></p></li><li><p><span>At this level, we will use category theoretic methods as a glue that can hold together a range of computational models, including models of programs and the process of computer programming. Monocl is an existing process modelling language that has been used to create an abstraction layer over a collection of data science programs. We plan to generalise this considerably.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Ultimately we plan to install these models in computational agents who can then “converse with each other to sharpen their wits,” as Turing anticipated, mirroring contemporary developments in self-play.  The design of the agents remains an open issue at the moment.  We are aware of interesting related work in proof generation and program synthesis, but so far this work only addresses part of the problem. We plan to bring in techniques from Bayesian learning, logic programming, and reinforcement learning.</span></p></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="this-work-can-contribute-significant-economic-value-over-reasonably-short-time-scales"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>This work can contribute significant economic value over reasonably short time scales.</span></span></h3><section><p><span>We will progress by producing ever-better models of human behaviour in computer-mediated communications around technical topics.  We anticipate potential routes-to-market focused on service provision for upskilling, lightweight automation, and support for custom model development.  We speculate that improved learning materials and tools will become the basis for a future community of highly skilled technical workers.</span></p><p><span>Looking ahead to the next months, we intend to create small demos across the pipeline, following a regular release schedule.  As time goes by, short blog posts will become inputs to research papers and usable tools. We will eventually pursue funding, ideally either in the form of direct revenue or grants, in order to allow us to work full time on these issues.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="progress-so-far"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Progress so far</span></span></h3><section><ul><li><p><span>Set up initial ghost blog</span></p></li><li><p><span>Drafted initial blog post</span></p></li><li><p><span>Update hyperreal.enterprises website to match current reality</span></p></li><li><p><span>We have tech set up to recording our meetings</span></p></li><li><p><span>Joe knows how to use OBS so can be a backup player</span></p></li><li><p><span>Seminar describing an Open IE approach with several notebooks</span></p></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="currently-active-projects"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Currently active projects</span></span></h3><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>#emacs-cloud-hypernotebooks</span></span></></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>#how-to-design-programs</span></span></></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>#text-analysis</span></span></></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>#model-construction</span></span></></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>#knowledge-graph</span></span></></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="tl;dr"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>TL;DR</span></span></h3><section><p><span>We are creating AI tools that will read the things people have written about computer programming and draw on these to find ways that computers can automatically create software.</span></p></section></div></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="top"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Top</span></span></h1><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="motivation:-for-the-sake-of-advancing-ai"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Motivation: For the sake of advancing AI</span></span></h2><section><p><span>We are doing this R&D work partly to make demonstrations of more
advanced AI systems.  We expect that our stance on AI will not
necessarily be a popular one.  But this is an important “minor” strand
of AI research dating back to Alan Turing:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>"As time goes on the [computer] itself will take over the functions
both of [programmers] and of [users]…The [programmers] are liable to
get replaced because as soon as any technique becomes at all
stereotyped it becomes possible to devise a system of instruction
tables which will enable the electronic computer to do it for
itself. It may happen however that the [programmers] will refuse to do
this. They may be unwilling to let their jobs be stolen from them in
this way. In that case they would surround the whole of their work
with mystery and make excuses, couched in well chosen gibberish,
whenever any dangerous suggestions were made." -- Alan Turing, 1947.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>On average, advanced AI would bring in new ways of working, and would
facilitate broad access to high-quality training.  This agenda could
serve to focus the mind of technical workers, but not many are
pursuing it presently.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="motivation:-technical-experiments-become-easier"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Motivation: Technical experiments become easier</span></span></h2><section><p><span>Even in the present time, without relying on any speculative AI
futures to magically appear, we can benefit from pursuing the agenda
above.  Accordingly, we are doing some applied work with existing
software that will give us a set of further tools and levers to work
with.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="representative-prior-work"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Representative Prior Work</span></span></h2><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="planetmath"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>PlanetMath</span></span></h3><section><p><span>PlanetMath users created a reasonably large informal mathematical
knowledge base together.  On the way, we came up with several
technical demos and sketched possible </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://github.com/holtzermann17/planetmath-docs/labels/PREVIEW" target="_blank">previews</a><span> for upcoming features.
One possible direction of work we looked at would be to focus on

to build computational models of informal mathematical reasoning.

chat, frequent short meetings.  We’ve talked about maintaining a blog
that would describe what we’re learning and developing.  So, roughly
speaking, we will try to develop a curriculum through the blog.  We
also have this wiki, that any of us can edit, which we can use as a
staging ground for more developed blog posts.  Our thought was that
blog posts might move in the direction of more developed outputs,
whether products or research papers.  We want to use some ideas
adapted from Scrum to build a shared awareness of what’s going on.
However, we want to be careful not to become “managerial” since
everyone is currently here as a volunteer, working on topics of his or
her own interest.  We want to provide mutual support and fun.
Reflection, whether in writing, or by recording and listening again to
conversations, should help with that.  We are not constraining things
to come out in a purely structured curriculum, or any other form of
product development.  “Users” and “customers” may appear as we release
things we are happy with and expand our little community.</span></p><blockquote><p><span>“Rousseau says, someone who has been properly educated will be engaged

kinds of errors (so, for debugging, teaching), and to support other
kinds of reasoning processes (e.g., turning Q’s into A’s in a

basis for this work.  We would want to respect category theoretic
concepts in the presentation.  We would expect to find analogues in
settings like Bayesian modelling.</span></p><p><span>We could proceed by looking at relationships with argumentation
theory, thinking about how to do this in a theoretically consistent
way.  Once we have a definition of the programming language we’re
going to use, we can then do argumentation over that.</span></p><p><span>Another strategy would be to develop a DSL for HtDP ideas, which we
could then reuseq to generate patterns for learning how to design
various structures (say, web pages or probabilistic programs).  To do
this well you’d need ways to express ‘recipes’.  For example, an MVP
might be based on representing HtDP-style recipes using sequent
calculi for session types.  These represent interactive protocols.</span></p><p><span>You’d use cut-elimination to have two players interact (using
something like the </span><strong><strong><span>Lakatos Game diagram</span></strong></strong><span>).  But what formalism
would you use?  E.g., </span><em><span>geometry of interaction in linear logic</span></em><span> has
been used for this kind of thing, but could it be used here?  With a
suitable formalism in place we would then imagine that a computer
programming agent would just follow the “Lakatos Game” style HtDP
script.  So, this would contribute to the development of agent models
for programming and program-related Q&A.</span></p></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="related-work"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Related work</span></span></h3><section><ul><li><p><span>General theory-informed algorithms (e.g., apply category theory to scientific models).</span></p></li><li><p><span>K framework: Have transformations for any language you define in it.</span></p></li><li><p><span>HtDP is similar applied to programming teaching.

This recovers some of the Research Collab ideas developed by Aaron
Krowne. It should integrate features such as writing and task
management (e.g., </span><em><span>Org</span></em><span>) Program evaluation (e.g., </span><em><span>Maxima</span></em><span>),
Typesetting and presentation (e.g., slides via </span><em><span>LaTeX</span></em><span>), and
navigation (e.g., </span><em><span>Org Roam</span></em><span> for displaying topics as a graph).  We
should be clear that the various technologies used are slot-fillers
and they might be replaced with other things, or augmented (e.g.,</span><em><span>Lean</span></em><span> for formal verification of some of the above?). A useful input
to this process would be implementation of examples without
integration.  This can then be redone in a more integrated fashion.</span></p><p><span>An integration using existing technologies will have limitations, once
we have this demos then we will see some of the gaps and how more
advanced tech could be useful. (For example, Ray’s work with Gerschom
could turn out to be useful here.)</span></p></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="abstract-for-emacsconf-2020"><span class="firn-headline-keyword firn-headline-keyword__DONE">DONE </span><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Abstract for EmacsConf 2020</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#joe">joe</a></span><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#ray">ray</a></span><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#cameron">cameron</a></span></span></h3></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="figure-out-subtasks-to-deliver"><span class="firn-headline-keyword firn-headline-keyword__TODO">TODO </span><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Figure out subtasks to deliver</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#joe">joe</a></span><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#ray">ray</a></span><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#cameron">cameron</a></span></span></h3></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="figure-out-how-ehn-relates-to-other-projects"><span class="firn-headline-keyword firn-headline-keyword__TODO">TODO </span><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Figure out how EHN relates to other projects</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#joe">joe</a></span><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#ray">ray</a></span><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#cameron">cameron</a></span></span></h3></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="partial-prototypes"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Partial prototypes</span></span></h3><section><p><span>Notice that crdt can be used inside folded nodes.</span></p><p><span>How far can we go...

here.  The idea would be to treat the top paragraph on each page as a
summary, and then add discussion threads below.  We’d want some system
of tags that indicated whether the summary was validated or now.
(Note the the original WikiWikiWeb did not have separate talk pages!
I don’t know if they practiced robust summarisation, either.)</span></p></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-17"><h6 class="firn-headline firn-headline-6" id="remark"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>REMARK</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#joe">joe</a></span></span></h6><section><p><span>This is an “inline task,” via </span><code>(require 'org-inlinetask)</code><span>.
