* 03 April 2021 — Emacs Research Group

We’ll be using the FOSS Host BBB. This allows recording, and we are in full.
- We might ask them someday about their setup

* Check-ins                                                            :20m:

** Raymond
- Busy with biology stuff, finishing things for that, Easter is tomorrow
- Cameron said he’d like to join but he has too many jobs right now
- Schedule is a bit crammed (peeragogy projects)
- 1 hour today;
** Noora
- Got 2nd vaccine shot on Monday, no side effects, just working all week after that
- Found a second committee member, need a 3rd one in the department, and 4th outside, and 1 external
- Have some people in mind after previous meetings, need some quant-heavy people to support modelling
** Leo
- Busy week, even though it was a holiday
- Today was packed, met with Tarsius (Magit), then Emacs Conf, now ERG
- Lots of progress on crowdfunding, some info later (10m)
- Feeling good, next week 1°C or so with snow in France
** Joe
- 2 calls family and Charlie call about peeragogy (Charlie will be extra busy next 2 or 3 months)
- Using Org Mode
- News: I’m in Oxford, you’re invited for next time you’re in town

* Things to keep in mind
** Record the sodding session

* Agenda
** Thinking Time                                                       :15m:
- We were going to look at CLA
- We had written a prose thing and I thought we could turn it into some todo items?
- Tyler (Firn guy) is making a nice TODO tracker in Firn — maybe invite him?
- Joe found a bibliography tool
*** Infrastructure stuff
- Thought: Peeragogy and authoring, *Logseq* + *Org Roam → *Firn *LaTeXML*
- Nice setting for people to use, we could use something similar with the biology
- Org Mode has nice TeX export, and nice inline expressions
- We could use Emacs running on the server to just do the rendering
$$\int \text{exp}(x) \, dx$$
- Fragtog — could it Org Mode create /HTML with the SVGs/ inside?
- LaTeXML, MathJaX — they don’t currently do commutative diagrams.
- What could we use in the meanwhile?
- We know that LaTeX can do everything!
- Deyan on BibLaTeX in LaTeXML: ticket has been open since 2013.
- Replacement for ShareLaTeX
** Logseq demo                                                         :30m:
*** This demo is private for us!
- Where did the outlice come from? It’s manual this time.
- Bibliography items are similarly cut-and-pasted
- Control-Enter to cycle through LATER, NEXT, DONE states which show up in squares
 - Maybe these things are configurable in the =.edn= file
- It’s nice that it’s block based (similar to Authorea solution which prevents problems with simultaneous editing)
- There’s a little (?) icon that gives hints
- LaTeX formulas are formatted with KaTeX or MathJaX? 
- =\[= won’t indent but =$$= does indent (even though in LaTeX they are supposed to be the same thing); =$$= is a macro in TeX
 - Maybe changing this is a 30 minute fix for a competent developer with this codebase
- Otherwise they are limited, and it can get confused — but it can do some reasonably intensive things (e.g., in the methods of characteristics page)
- =\begin{aligned}= versus =\begin{align}= which is what we would expect
- With the SVG solution you could be guaranteed that it produces TeX
- Users are excited to jump on the ship but there’s so much that seems under-cooked
- Worth looking to see whether the relevant parts are open source...
 - Parts are being closed ‘for security reasons’
- Permissions are given for the Logseq app to access your selected repository
*** Useful because
- Can use it in any computer
- And it’s an overlay on a git repo
- It automatically commits and merges things intelligent — which is a big advantage
- It will ask you if both people edit in exactly the same place
- It does this after leaving each block
*** Weaknesses
- TeX support
- Security business... or is this just an approach to financial security?
*** Review
- Reusing many existing open source software (maybe some GPL), LaTeXML, Org Mode parser, etc.
- Still miles away from what we /could/ be doing
- Like: it displays it as an interlinked thing
- It’s easy to store on top of Git (no database)
- Does a reasonably good job of resolving conflicts
- Block editing
*** Response
- We’d be happy with these features with any platform!
- So do take notes of what’s working, not working
- It needs to be an effort that’s well-coordinated:
- Org-element needs to be externalised
 - So that efficient parsers in Rust or whatever can do this
- The reason this is essential is I want to do things well from the get-go
- ‘I’ could write a /decent/ Org Mode parser, but want something that will last
- Why do we need one in Rust?  We have one in Emacs; couldn’t it do all the parsing?
- Yes, LISP does it well, but it’s hard to parallelise.
- It’s easier to externalise this than implement threading (so, port to Common Lisp? Clojure?)
- Short term: maybe having Emacs as the intermediary server could work!
 - The problems with these methods, though, is that we might resort to shortcuts
- What about just accessing Emacs like via TMUX? You can type, you get bindings and such
 - Yes, I’d love this!
 - Keybindings C-c, C-n
 - How to handle pictures?
 - How to handle synchronisation?
- You can do this with Bravo...
- Or don’t ask them to install anything, turn off all the keybindings
- CUA mode, CRDT, category theory diagrams
- Hacker Andy — side-by-side windows does exist
- There is demand even for easy solutions...
- 3.3k
*** We don’t know if Emacs is the obstacle until we ask, e.g., Ximo
- Now at least we know what the conflicts are
- What are different needs, time-constraints, how much we can deal with
** Catch up on Leo’s Crowdfunding                                      :15m:
*** Overflow from the Logseq demo
- If it takes a year to externalise the Org Mode parser, what will people do in the meanwhile?
- What about just getting a clone of Logseq that 
- Worried about the potatoes vs the gravy on top
- Emacs in the browser is a disagreement between Ray and Leo?
- The web is the way of the future... or is it?  The web stifles our ability for design!
- This isn’t just about Org mode, it’s about Emacs at large
- That said, if we had an external parser we could have an external interface to Emacs
- Is there something that has both long-term and something that works today?
- NA: I get it about making something inclusive, having this be an easy interface
- Co-authors won’t work with anything that takes work
- LV: I know people who can implement this in the web... but you need to find a way to justify it, and they will want to do it intelligently
- This is similar to the ‘uncanny valley’ but here it’s the opposite: Anything that’s not 95% complete, whatever the missing 5% is, it will seem to be utter shite
- “I need this in my workflow” people will see only the missing things
- “I need to have my paper in a journal, and I need to have commutative diagrams in it”
 - Either find developers like Joe who are willing to implement short-term solutions
 - Or find whatever solution that works in the short term
 - BUT then let’s have a comprehensive plan
- Cameron, Ximo, and Ray are using Overleaf — but this forces everything to be a draft of a paper
*** Logseq is frustrating though
- LV: The conventions around payment piss me off
- What I’m saying is not “use other tools” 
 - I need stories of software that work, software that doesn’t work
 - I’ll distill these and develop things
 - I’d love to start working on this now, but I can’t justify to do it like this
 - Org mode has been there 15 years, all attempts to get it into the web have been sub-par
*** Short recap of the day’s activity
- Fun 2 hour talk with Tarsius
- Convinced him to join EmacsConf
- Decided not to use Kickstarter b/c it takes too much of a cut
  - (PayPal and other platforms better)
  - Need to direct people to these things
  - Do a 30 day campaign, publishing things, going to user group channels
  - Rather than trying to bank €40K, instead aim for €2K/month directly
- Tarsius wanted a figure (see the bar getting filled)
- Try to find a way to account for, e.g., Paypal, just divide donations by 12 to get the figure
- Ask friends, package maintainers, and such to pitch in
- And don’t need to aim for a high figure
- Also got confirmation from Etalab that will get paid for the 80% of the contract he’s done already
- So, €6K after tax...
- Depending on how to come up the monthly thing... if I get <1500, will need a side job
- If I get >2500, then this is the main job
- Can make the coaching thing a perk
- Can start with a progress bar
- Won’t have as much visibility, but should hopefully be able to get towards something sustainable
- And you’ll get visibility later
** Meta
- LV: French accent increases when I don’t breathe

:END:
*** 1. Review the intention: what do we expect to learn or make together?
- Intended to be here!
- We’re still here even though we’re busy with other things!
*** 2. Establish what is happening: what and how are we learning?
- Leo’s had more than 5 hours of Org and Emacs activities and is pretty saturated
- When you see others haven’t made it to this baseline...
*** 3. What are some different perspectives on what’s happening?
- LV: Feels like the discussion with Ray silenced Noorah?
- Maybe not so much sunshine today
- Deadlines are creeping up...
- We all have deadlines coming up
- ERG is creating a beautiful child!
- We hit into some key issues — many of us are trying to do science outside 
*** 4. What did we learn or change?
- JC: I was happy to see Ray’s use of Logseq
- We also managed to describe some of the real-world conflicts depending on the users
- ‘postlapsarian’ is not a word
*** 5. What else should we change going forward?
- New user on Noorah’s Windows machine called “Dissertation”
- User stories will be interesting to see (‘Black and White’)
- Bibliographies, demo of Dissertation user, a longer thing for next time
- Noorah will have time to prep this
- Joe could maybe do a little prep on the CLA paragraph
- Make a template, erg-push-button solution would be nice (20 minute job)
- Using it should bring joy, when compared with Git and Tramp etc.
- But how to anticipate how far
- Exciting to think about ‘the future of emacs, free software, citizen science’
