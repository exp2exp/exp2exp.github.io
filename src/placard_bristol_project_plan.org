* General process of the workshop

** Pre-workshop

/(Dec 15th? 29th; Jan 12th? as _soonest_ possible, but maybe better to push it to January.)/

- We would be able to present how we work with this stuff
- We’d even a *present-only version* done optimistically for 3rd and 4th / and for sure by 10th December.

How to value the prep work that we’ve already done?
How to manage the scaling up process?

** Phase I: Process input needs
- Consider *centralising the data*, since a lot of stuff is currently buried
- Explain where the notes are, how to find the LaTeX files, git repos, &c.
- This follows patterns of the EmacsConf organisation, e.g., minimal commits, logs, etc.

** Phase II: Strategy: consider using Org Roam intelligently
- We’d stopped using it as we originally intended, and just had meeting notes
- Leo’s happy to create a slip-box following the patterns of Noorah’s agenda & create an operational manual
- This will be a ‘moderated’ shared slip box; we can have all the data so far, can create notes, read things, etc.
- *Method for maintaining structure* can be taught later after we have the contents

** Plan
- Make sure that we have things well prepared
- We do have a =yasnippet= based workflow for running the *meetings*, could we do something similar with the workflow for the *workshop*?
- This can be "Phase III"
- Use a common agenda file for the Abby project; it will live somewhere we can all access & track tasks
