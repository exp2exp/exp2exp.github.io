Here I describe the resonances that I am thinking about (across the
wiki), and compare my writing with the musical genre of ‘sludge’.
Then I start to reflect on how people don’t necessarily have
incentives to stop and think about how things work.  I compare
reasonable and unreasonable thinking.  Then I talk about how when I
was first trying to think about these issues I thought in terms of
‘hypertext’.  I’m alluding to Deleuze’s /Logic of Sense/ as far as I can
remember what he says there.
