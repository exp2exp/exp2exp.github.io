* 12 March 2022  — Emacs Research Group


* Check-ins
:PROPERTIES:
:Effort:   0:15
:END:

** NA
- Affected by a sandstorm and Zirtek, prefers to do a check in and then go back to bed today!
  - JC: Recommends Vitamin C powder with electrolytes.
- Has icons in Org Agenda

** JC
- Haven’t finished the budget
- Let’s discuss ‘what is a pattern’ in an ongoing fashion

** LV
- Let’s not push the whole meeting to Tuesday!

* Meta points

** TODO Don't forget to record the session!                             :LV:

* TODO Pre-PAR — Review the intention: what do we expect to learn or make together?

- Sort out the invoicing
- Look at patterns more later, so we don’t get too much influenced by Joe’s prior preparation

* Agenda (Part 1 — Invoicing)
:PROPERTIES:
:Effort: 0:20

** From last time:
1) We need to spend as little time as possible coming up with this quote, because this is not the real work being done.
2) We need the invoice to be satisfactory for Abby’s institution.

Picking the right words for purposes of being clearer; interested in
the longer term on thinking about these terms.  Thinking about it in
detail is something we can do separately and come back together about
first.

** Patterns

(1) According to the Peeragogy project (2015), patterns are imperfect, and have NEXT STEPS that allow them to be progressively better realised within a context.  This means that they can be used for distributed project management.  (This is quite different from the classical Alexandrian view; but coherent with the contemporary "Objectives and Key Results" management strategy.)

(2) Patterns are necessarily contextual.  This is a classical Alexandrian point of view, which can supported by references to Simondon's concept of the pre-individual.  A related observation is that patterns are "processual" in nature; this supports (1).  (NB. Context-specificity is in tension with transferability between contexts.  This tension is itself a "meta-pattern".)

(3) Patterns are "teachable methods".  This is explained by Leitner.  This also suggests that patterns are "mathetic" in nature (i.e., they are informative teaching-and-learning objects).  This connects patterns to the work of Alan Mathison Turing. 

(4) Patterns are strongly akin to "institutions" in Elinor Ostrom's terminology.  Therefore, Ostrom's principles for institutional design should be relevant as guidance for the creation of pattern-languages.  I discussed Ostrom's principles here: http://metameso.org/~joe/papers/corneli2016institutional.pdf  (While this probably won't put us on a direct path to the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, it would be useful to learn from someone who got one.)

*** 2. Establish what is happening: what and how are we learning?
- Glad we went through the quote but it shouldn’t take 1h20 minutes; we could have spent our time more efficiently
*** 3. What are some different perspectives on what's happening?
- LV: I didn’t even get a chance to do the check-in!
- LV & NA were both feeling under the weather
*** 4. What did we learn or change?
- Overall, we weren’t so inclined to work today and would rather hang out, invoicing is pretty perfunctory.
*** 5. What else should we change going forward?
- Typesetting together is inefficient!
