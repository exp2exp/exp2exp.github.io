#+title: Construct, critique, improve models of the creative process
#+roam_tags: HL

We want tools and processes for working with models, with a particular
emphasis on improved models of the creative process. The reason for
this emphasis is that if we have good models of the creative process,
including the modelling process, we can then apply them to a wide
range of problems!  This prompts reflection on the infrastructure and
tools that we are actually using.
