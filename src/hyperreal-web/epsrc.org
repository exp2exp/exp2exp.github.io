#+title: Large-scale Epistemic Agent-based Processes for Question Answering (LEAPQA)
#+filetags: :web:

The LEAPQA project will use artificial intelligence to create an online
learning support tool for technical training in computer science and
mathematics. Our strategy is to model both the technical content that
users contribute to the popular Stack Exchange network of question and
answer websites, as well as the epistemic process of learning through
Q&A dialogues. Computer programs will be written to accomplish two
tasks: (T1) workable, albeit partial, translation of technical natural
language texts into formal knowledge representations; and (T2)
functional processes for heuristic reasoning that act on the
above-mentioned representations to pose and solve practical problems in
the domain.⊕[[https://hyperreal.enterprises/img/lion-and-unicorn.png]]
The fidelity and usefulness of this model will be evaluated in two ways:
(i) via synthetic research based on computational challenges that agents
can only solve if they have a good model of the domain, and, (ii) via
user studies with an intelligent tutoring system built using the agent
model. In the intelligent tutoring application, bots will help novice
learners answer their own questions, employing George Pólya's chief
heuristic: “If you can't solve a problem, then there is an easier
problem you can solve: find it” [[#section1][[1]]]. The evaluations will
allow us to answer this Research question: Can autonomous computational
agents build an explicit, functional, model of the knowledge and
epistemic processes that underlie a large technical corpus written by
many authors?

This proposal targets the Priority Area: High Productivity Services
through Specialised Artificial Intelligence. The specific service sector
targeted is education. Links between skill acquisition, higher
productivity, and economic performance are well established
[[#section2][[2]]]. As society is transformed by technology, it is
crucial that we transform education to keep up. Indeed, Developing
skills is one of ten pillars in the UK's Industrial Strategy. Doug Lenat
remarks in AI Magazine that “The popularity of massive open online
courses (MOOCs) and the Khan Academy are early indicators of how much
demand there is even for non-AI-based education courseware”
[[#section3][[3]]]. Dame Wendy Hall and Jérôme Pesenti conclude that “AI
could positively affect every area of STEM education”
[[#section4][[4]]].

For example, Georgia Tech professor Ashok Goel used IBM Bluemix to
create a digital TA that could answer routine questions on his course's
forum [[#section5][[5]]]. LEAPQA will follow this line of thinking to
work at scale, using data supplied by Stack Exchange Inc., a for-profit
company that maintains popular open source “Web 2.0” Q&A websites
including Stack Overflow (14m questions, 10m answers). Whereas Stack
Overflow serves developers who need answers to one-off questions, our
tutoring platform will provide the structured and continuous support
needed by novice learners. The scientific aspects of the proposal centre
on this Hypothesis: Technical Q&A interaction patterns (1) can be
modelled with computational agents to allow them to learn from each
other in dialogue, and thereby (2) develop an operational understanding
of the contents of symbolic domains, which can (3) be used as the basis
of effective tutoring systems for technical topics.

** Economic benefits for the UK
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: economic-benefits-for-the-uk
   :END:
/Short Term/ Potential applications range from “technical education for
those not pursuing an academic path” [[#section6][[6]]] to effective
on-the-job learning for professionals who aim to acquire new skills
quickly. Learning technology is volatile, and consumers are “migrating
rapidly to more efficient knowledge and learning transfer products”
[[#section7][[7]]]. To offset the risk associated with entering a
volatile industry, software produced during the project will be released
under a suitable open source license to encourage innovation by third
parties. Open source software has both commercial opportunities and
public good properties. Wikipedia, which has an education oriented
mission -- but which does not yet offer a tutoring service -- is “an
asset worth tens of billions of dollars that produces hundreds of
billions of dollars of consumer benefit” [[#section8][[8]]].

/Long Term/ The learning model pioneered in the LEAPQA project will
accelerate the development of artificially intelligent systems for
programming and other symbolic tasks, with potentially transformative
impact across the economy.

** Scientific track record:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: scientific-track-record
   :END:
I have a diverse and well-integrated set of research accomplishments,
centred around the development of mathematical AI. My first journal
publications were in pure mathematics. After graduation, I worked for a
summer at the artificial intelligence firm Cycorp, Inc., and then with
PlanetMath.org, Ltd., a nonprofit that created one of the earliest
online communities devoted to facilitating global access to mathematical
knowledge. Asking how to sustain the impact of this work led to my
doctoral research at the Open University's Knowledge Media Institute.
Partly inspired by my research on “Peer Produced Peer Learning”
[[#section9][[9]]], communications scholar Howard Rheingold convened the
Peeragogy project in connection with his 2011 Berkeley Regents lecture
[[#section10][[10]]]. I participated as the coordinating editor for the
Peeragogy Handbook [[#section11][[11]]] and together with a global team
gathered design patterns for effective collaboration and peer-to-peer
learning [[#section12][[12]]]. I also worked with a team at Jacobs
University, Bremen, as the lead developer of a new software system for
PlanetMath that was selected as a Finalist in Elsevier's “Executable
Paper Challenge” [[#section13][[13]]]. In my first postdoctoral position
at Goldsmiths, University of London, I published extensively on
computational creativity, and in 2016 garnered a Best Paper award at the
International Conference on Computational Creativity for a paper dealing
with autonomous evaluation of creative work [[#section14][[14]]]. A
software prototype that I had developed to help theorise interactions on
PlanetMath [[#section15][[15]]] has evolved into the technical basis of
a model of mathematical communication that underpins LEAPQA
[[#section16][[16]]]. My most recent journal publication in Artificial
Intelligence puts this work on a strong foundation, using the tools and
formal theories of argumentation.[[#section17][[17]]]

** My research vision:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: my-research-vision
   :END:
Building agent-based models of contemporary social machines is a new
approach to the classic challenges of artificial intelligence. Whereas
machine learning alone can master subsymbolic domains, as Turing had
already anticipated [[#section18][[18]]], agent models are on the
critical path to (super-)intelligent systems with meaningful behaviour
in symbolic domains. This project is, thus, a route to developing
Human-Like Computing , a major challenge within the EPSRC's Future
Intelligent Technologies priority area. The EPSRC's strategy highlights
the grand challenge of building a system that will “allow training where
there is no human expert, or a lack of time or resources”
[[#section19][[19]]]. Describing his experiments with an AI teaching
assistant, Ashok Goel pointed out (Note [[#section5][[5]]]) that rapid
progress was made possible by explicitly including a model of
interaction in the system, along with a model of content. My background
in argumentation research will help with this aspect, but I will rely on
a Research Associate (RA) with expertise relevant to T1-translation to
work on other aspects of the dataand language-oriented research
programme. The candidate pool may include, but will not be limited to,
researchers who have experience with mathematical language
([[#section20][[20]]], [[#section21][[21]]], [[#section22][[22]]]). I
will focus on T2-reasoning and the synthetic evaluation work that will
strengthen the system's abilities. Both staff members will work jointly
on the application to tutoring, which will involve subject-matter
experts (SMEs) and novice learners in research studies that fine-tune
the prototype and evaluate its usefulness in tutoring contexts. We will
use early deployment of a working prototype, progressively improved
models of real-world content, continual testing of agent behaviour
through synthetic means, and direct engagement with potential users to
develop a marketable proof-of-concept.

** Personal motivation:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: personal-motivation
   :END:
My core motivation in the project is to use inspiring ideas from AI
research to build a practical system for technical education. Not only
do I have an innovative idea about how to combine social computing and
artificial intelligence in this application: I also match the demanding
person specification. I have experience delivering high-quality research
in both artificial intelligence and social computing. I have created
software that is in public use. I have experience collaborating with
both small interdisciplinary research teams and globally active
organisations. I am excited about developing new business models for
education using open source software and cutting-edge AI technologies.

** Overview of project objectives:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: overview-of-project-objectives
   :END:
LEAPQA will focus on modelling three sites in the Stack Exchange
network: Stack Overflow (the most popular sub-site, devoted to
programming questions), math.stackexchange.com (the second-most popular
subsite, for mathematics questions below research level), and
MathOverflow (a specialist site for research mathematics).

*** Objective 1. Modelling dialogues with computational agents that
learn.
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: objective-1.-modelling-dialogues-with-computational-agents-that-learn.
    :END:
(a) Agents discuss hypotheses about Stack Exchange data in light of
evidence. This example dialogue might ensue when modelling a
Mathoverflow question [[#section3][[23]]]:

/Agent A/: “In this query [linked ] the ‘infinite case' is mentioned,
but what value is infinite?”\\
/Agent B/: “Based on follow-up comment #2 [linked], it appears that
either the subgroup's order or its index could be infinite.”

(Note that this dialogue would in fact take place in a simplified
process language.) (b) Agents will alter their programming based on
these interactions. For example, from the above dialogue, Agent A might
learn to look at follow-up comments to check cases of ambiguity.

*** Objective 2. Developing an operational understanding of the contents
of symbolic domains.
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: objective-2.-developing-an-operational-understanding-of-the-contents-of-symbolic-domains.
    :END:
The primary technical challenge faced in the LEAPQA project is (a) to
apply our existing modelling language (Notes [[#section16][[16]]],
[[#section23][[23]]]) at a large scale (i) on Stack Exchange, rather
than working by hand to meticulously study smaller examples as we did
when designing the language. We will follow Kaliszyk et al, who show
that certain schematic patterns are frequently used in mathematical text
([[#section24][[24]]], [[#section25][[25]]]) and devise software to
recognise common patterns in technical language and translate them to
our representation language. (ii ) As a scientific control (to ensure
coverage of basic topics), we will also apply this technique to several
standard textbooks, and correlate their contents with Stack Exchange
questions. (b) Zhang et al show that it is possible to predict “coarse”
structure of dialogue using machine learning techniques
[[#section26][[26]]]. Once we have a more detailed model of what is
said, we can make more fine-grained predictions. /(i)/ We will formalise
common patterns of interaction as dialogue games to facilitate reasoning
about process [[#section27][[27]]]. /(ii)/ We will also expand the
system's ability to enact processes by integrating external systems.

*** Objective 3. Evaluate computational agents' abilities with synthetic
tasks and applications to tutoring.
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: objective-3.-evaluate-computational-agents-abilities-with-synthetic-tasks-and-applications-to-tutoring.
    :END:
Agent-based simulations afford (a) a range of preliminary validation
steps that are easier to achieve than full-blown question answering or
pedagogical diagnostics. For example, several synthetic challenges of
increasing difficulty: (i ) match an existing answer with its
corresponding question (selecting from a small pool of possible
choices); (ii ) identify questions that have been tagged as “duplicates”
(given questions in order, but not tags); (iii ) identify existing
answers that would help address a given question, and explain why. When
the agents' abilities have been sufficiently developed in synthetic
experiments, we will experiment with human subjects with two goals: (b)
to test whether agents can be effectively taught by human instructors,
and (c), mutatis mutandis, to establish whether automated feedback from
agents is useful for human learners.

** Related Work:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: related-work
   :END:
About 20% of the edits on the English Wikipedia are currently carried
out by bots [[#section28][[28]]]. To accomplish this, the bots need a
robust but not terribly sophisticated understanding of some limited
aspects of Wikipedia's model. Projects have also been initiated to build
a “Wikipedia” and a “World Wide Web” exclusively for robots
[[#section29][[29]]]. And yet, these sites do not share the key feature
in the current proposal, which aims to model user behaviour, not just to
amass factual or procedural knowledge. Experience from my doctoral
research is relevant to user modelling: drawing on a decade of
interaction data, I applied a contemporary statistical model that
differentiates between two kinds of learning, using technical keywords
as an indicator [[#section30][[30]]]. Expertise and learning have been
studied on Stack Exchange as well: indicators include users' voting
behaviour [[#section31][[31]]] and topic models [[#section32][32]].
Bansal et al point out that skill development through “self-play” --
famously used by DeepMind to improve AlphaGo -- is of broad use in
training agent systems [[#section4][[33]]]. In a semantics-rich
environment like Stack Exchange, interaction between agents also needs a
rich semantics. Our approach will use “critics”, pioneered by Sussman
[[#section34][[34]]], and applied more recently by Singh
[[#section35][[35]]]. A Sussman-style approach has the further benefit
of supporting explanatory models of epistemic behaviour, as required by
Objective 3(a)(iii). Ground-truthed questions based on free text
understanding provide a “neutral” challenge and a further route to
evaluation [[#section36][[36]]].

Integrating external commercial systems into SE′, as collections of

will work with the IBM Bluemix Garage to create a working prototype
ready for public deployment within the first six months of the project.
This strategy will enable us to adapt the platform based on its
behaviour and the needs of early users. Cycorp has offered a free
ResearchCyc license that will help extend the system's reasoning
capabilities. Research visits to Cycorp and to IBM's headquarters are
budgeted for and will be arranged when we have interesting results to
discuss.

I will work with the partners in the EPSRC Platform grant led by Andrew
Ireland on “The Integration and Interaction of Multiple Mathematical
Reasoning Processes” (EP/N014758/1) to provide a pathway to deployed

Wolfram Research's Mathematica as a demonstrator. I will arrange a visit
to Wolfram Research's offices in Oxford.

(EP/N014871/1). I will work with my collaborator Alison Pease on
detecting and formalising patterns of interaction in technical
discussions.

*** M19-M27. Technical work behind the scenes.
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: m19-m27.-technical-work-behind-the-scenes.

In order to understand the way mathematicians and programmers learn from
Q&A dialogues, I will involve expert users directly in training the
system. An interface that allows these SMEs to critique the system's
behaviour will be deployed, and the system improved in response to three
separate in-person studies.

    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: m28-m36.-intelligent-tutoring.
    :END:
In order to develop a framework that facilitates good outcomes for
students, I will consult with Johanna Moore and Chris Sangwin, experts
in automatic tutoring and technology enhanced education at the
University of Edinburgh. Longitudinal classroom-based studies will focus
on specific technical areas (e.g., Calculus) in order to facilitate
assessment of impact on learning outcomes.

** Outreach.

My research has a fundamentally interdisciplinary scope, taking into
account social institutions, learning, and computational modelling. This
interdisciplinary mix has led to a novel proposal for building AI

The work outlined builds on my strong track record in both areas. The
methods may extend to other fields, with broad social impact. I
demonstrate leadership potential through my advocacy work as well as
through innovative research, evidenced, e.g., by invited talks

This proposal addresses the priority area “High Productivity Services
through Artificial Intelligence, data and digital technologies” outlined
in the call, and the “Developing skills” pillar of the Industrial
Strategy. The project is aligned with the EPSRC's Future Intelligent
Technologies Cross-ICT priority area and will also impact the
Mathematical Sciences research theme. The proposed work builds upon a
suggestion from AI pioneer Alan Turing that is only now within our
reach: modelling epistemic processes at a large scale using agent
technologies. The project integrates ideas from social computing, agent
modelling, and knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR). The primary
application will be to intelligent tutoring for technical education. The
project will run June 29, 2018--June 28, 2021. The project team will be
comprised of the PI who will be appointed at the Senior Research
Associate level [Line Item 1] and one Research Associate with a
background in natural language processing (NLP) and other skills
relevant to the challenge of extracting technical content from online
dialogues [Line Item 2] . Technical texts pose a number of challenges
that are not directly present in mainstream NLP, because they intermix
domain specific languages (e.g., complex formulae) and exposition. The
challenges involved justify the appointment of a postdoctoral researcher
(or someone with equivalent experience). The RA will have a 35 month
contract in order to facilitate the search for suitable candidates. The
PI will spend approximately 80% time working on developing an
agent-based model that mirrors the epistemic interactions on Stack
Exchange. Reasoning effectively about technical content involves both
common sense and domain-specific models. Outreach and dissemination
activities will take 15% of the PI's time, and the other 5% will be
spent on management and supervision. The RA will focus on technical
tasks but will also be involved in research studies and paper writing.
The project will involve visits to industrial and academic partners both
overseas [Line Item 3] and in the UK [Line Item4]. Research outputs will
be presented at international conferences on artificial intelligence
[Line Item 5]. Travel to carry out research studies and to engage in
impact activies is budgeted for [Line Item 6].

arranged when we have significant results to discuss that industry
experts can help us extend. Consultations with developers and expert
users of mathematical software systems (4.2--4.3) will enable us to
integrate key domain-specific provisions. The PI will spend two weeks
during the first half of the project working with the Arg-Tech group at
the University of Dundee to formally model argument structures (4.4) and
two weeks in the second half of the project designing experiments with
experts at the University of Edinburgh (4.5). Presentations at leading
AI conferences (5.1--5.2) will be a primary means of disseminating the
project results. We will also engage with discipline specific
conferences (5.4--5.6) with the aim of building informal collaborations
with international partners. The amounts requested take into account the
varying prices of travel and registration. In order to quickly develop a
working model that can be deployed early on and extended throughout the
project by our project staff, IBM's Bluemix Garage consultancy will be
retained for an initial round of design and prototyping during the first
six months of the project [Line Item 7]. This will lead to a robust
development plan and a working prototype. Both staff members will
participate in the prototyping activities via “pair programming”
sessions with IBM staff. The justification for the significant expense
associated with retaining an expert software consultancy is that we can
deploy a working version of the system early on, and adapt it in light
of feedback from early adopters and the system's own online behaviour.
The platform will therefore have seen over a year of active use before
we begin formal studies with SMEs in month 19. This will make it easier
for SMEs to focus on substance rather than on difficulties with the
platform. IBM Bluemix was used by Ashok Goel to build the AI teaching
assistant “Jill Watson”, which received considerable coverage in the
popular press. A multi-agent variant of Jill Watson is an approximate
description our development goal, which justifies using a similar
technical approach. The Bluemix Garage has agreed to discount the usual
price of their consultancy services by £11K.

Apart from informal feedback on the public deployment, and evaluation in
synthetic research challenges, the system will be robustly assessed in
two structured phases of formal research studies. In the first phase,
subject-matter experts (SMEs) will be engaged to train the system [Line
Item 9]. This will be carried out in three separate studies to allow
adjustments to be made between studies. In each study, five SMEs will be
involved, and will be compensated for 6 to 15 hours of participation
which can be spread out over a week. The system will be explained and
project staff will be available to help users work with the interface
during the first day of the study. SMEs will be rewarded for their
participation with £10/hour in Amazon vouchers. In the second phase,
students will use the system in a longitudinal study in connection with
coursework and will not be compensated.

The project will take place in the Knowledge Media Institute of The Open
University [Line Items 9 and 10]. The themes of the proposal match
several key research strengths of KMi: knowledge extraction, artificial
intelligence, and applications to education. The PI will report to KMi's
Director, John Domingue.

Two primary business models will be explored in the outreach phase. The
first model is straightforward service provision, in which extensions to
the platform are contracted for and developed in-house. In the second
model, the platform is seen as a multi-sided marketplace, with
certification and regulatory oversight provided centrally. Both models
have the potential for significant short-term benefits to the UK through
direct applications in technical education in line with the Industrial
Strategy. Over the long term, the approach is expected to generalise to
other intelligent service applications.
