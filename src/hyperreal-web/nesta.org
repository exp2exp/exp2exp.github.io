Can we create learning opportunities leading to meaningful work for
billions of people? A place to start is with sites like Stack Exchange,
GitHub, and Wikipedia. For many, these are places to ask questions,
share answers, solve problems, and understand the world we live in
better. And yet many others are not presently able make much use of
these resources.

Since 2012, the Peeragogy Project has been building a collection of
informal design patterns for effective peer learning and peer
production. In the AI for Good programme, the new company Hyperreal
Enterprises will translate these patterns into a software tool that can
be used to organise open source materials into "peeragogical pathways"
that support learning and development. In the words of their originator,
Christopher
Alexander:⊕[[https://hyperreal.enterprises/img/bennet-court.png]]

“Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in
our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that
problem, in a way that you can use this solution a million times over,
without ever doing it the same way twice.”

We are concerned with problems of human infrastructure. Our solutions
will augment existing resources and workflows with AI methods that
support learning and co-production at scale.

(if applicable).

This proposal builds on prior interdisciplinary collaboration in the
Peeragogy Project and formal research into applications of AI within
collaborations.

The /Peeragogy Handbook/ (4th ed. forthcoming 2020) includes a growing
collection of design patterns that model the activities that take place
in peer learning and peer production. We have innovated on the classic
pattern language template by adding a “*What's Next*” step to each of
our patterns. Thus, each of our patterns is linked with a number of
“issues” that reflect the way that the pattern is being put into
practice in the project. The same methodology can be used to make sense
of the issues and challenges faced in other projects.

The other strand of research examines collaboration with an eye to
building “mixed initiative” AI systems. This work has resulted in
publications in the journals /Artificial Intelligence/ and
/Argumentation/ [1], [2]. We modelled the way people collaborate to
create mathematical proofs, by building a “dialogue game” that describes
exploratory mathematical thinking, and constructed an empirical model of
real-world mathematical dialogues. This work was additionally supported
by small-scale experiments with a novel reasoning system [3].

*Skills development*, including “reskilling” for the digital economy,
through participation in open source projects. This will have further
knock-on benefits. GitHub's director of social impact, Admas Kanyagia,
observes that open source has the “power to drive collaboration and
shared expertise to drive innovation and change and to build communities
particularly with multiple and diverse perspectives" [1].

The central issue we are tackling is the “skills gap”, within the
broader context of a transition to a knowledge economy. The problem has
many well-documented facets. Hired.com found a significant *gap in the
UK's technical skills* [1]. Nesta reckons there will be an *increasing
need for social skills and learning skills* as well [2]. Nevertheless,
the Learning and Work Institute highlights that participation in
learning within the UK is at *an all-time low* [3]. Furthermore, the
OECD found that simply deploying technology within classrooms does
little to *bridge the gap* between advantaged and disadvantaged students
[4].

We will focus on inclusive uses of technology to support skill
acquisition at scale. We are inspired by the London-based *Founders and
Coders* collective [5] which is able to provide free technical training
to selected applicants, leading to gainful employment. We want to expand
the benefits of peer learning to anyone who has an internet connection.
We will build on prior research into peer learning and peer production,
and emphasise interacting systems, diverse skillsets, and human
relationships.

** At what stage is your project?

Within the Peeragogy Project, our design patterns for peer learning and
peer production exist at a ‘proof of concept' stage. In particular, we
have used the patterns within this project to help manage our workflow.
In the new project outlined here, we will move this material into a
software ‘prototype' that will interoperate with existing sources of
open data.

** Describe your project - what is it you are doing?

The core technical activities combine human learning, machine learning,
and logic:

*1.* Harvest issues from GitHub, Stack Exchange, and Wikimedia projects.

*2.* Tag a subset of this material using the Peeragogy design patterns
(e.g., Newcomer, Heartbeat, Wrapper, etc.). Expand the collection of
patterns to ensure meaningful coverage.

*3.* Tagging will give us a collection of terms that can be used to
detect patterns in a broader data collection using a standard machine
learning approach.

*4.* Operationalise the design patterns in code, with multiple
implementations. We will be able to detect patterns when they appear,
and also implement them programmatically when they do not. For example,
we might detect that a project has a low level of ongoing activity but
no "*Heartbeat*", and accordingly suggest a regular meeting time.

*5.* We will orchestrate the patterns in combination with each other,
discovering complex synergies that lead to learning success, and forging
new connections between related projects so that they can support each
other.

*6.* We will be able to demonstrate new potential team-ups and other
opportunities for exchange; new workflows and value propositions,
learning prerequisites and outcomes.

We will engage with relevant designers and users at least two workshops.

AI applications to human learning are often geared towards students in
formal educational settings. *Automated tutoring* is poised to become a
major business, and several large-scale investments and deployments
already exist. However, this does little to assist with informal
learning and online collaboration; and, per the OECD report mentioned
above, questions remain about the social impact of such interventions.

Design patterns have been applied on an experimental basis within
computational design projects, starting from a vision outlined by TP
Moran [1]. The very first wiki was created to keep track of design
patterns related to programming. However, there has been surprisingly
little attention to the use of design patterns to bridge between
collective and artificial intelligence.

This project will draw on symbolic methods and will combine them with
“big data” to progressively build a model of the patterns in open source
projects, including Wikimedia projects and Stack Exchange
question-and-answer dialogues [2], [3]. ‘Bots' are well-accepted in
these environments, however a focus on learning support is novel.

The AI for Good initiative will help Hyperreal Enterprises develop into
a new kind of company. We will be able to connect with local talent and
other UK-based initiatives during the programme. At the same time, we
must recognise that the “skills gap” is properly global in scope [1],
and we aim to address it on a global scale. Hyperreal Enterprises will
build on public data to enhance the existing global knowledge commons.
In the curated programme we will co-learn in direct contact with other
progressive initiatives, and contact related endeavours sponsored by the
Centre for Collective Intelligence Design [2]. We will be able to give
something back by contributing to a better understanding of how CI
projects can succeed. More specifically, while there are many ways to
apply AI within CI [3], the present project moves in the direction of
building computational models of CI itself. We aim to show this is an
appropriate and effective way to scaffold engagement with CI, and skill
development more broadly. Alongside working software, we will use
workshops and hands-on learning experiences to co-develop an engaging
vision.

*Lack of interest* is the biggest documented obstacle to learning [1].
Many open source projects and new wikis fail to attract contributors,
and even successful projects typically decline in popularity as time
goes by [2]. AI can help by working transversally across projects and
assembling communities of collaborators, users, and supporters.

Addressing this challenge requires a different way of thinking about
software that takes into account its social side. Joe Corneli and
colleagues at the University of Edinburgh developed an innovative data
science course and ‘data fair' model [3], [4]. Building a similar
initiative that cuts across institutional boundaries will be a novel
challenge.

*The primary strategy to address these challenges will be through
transdisciplinary collaboration.* For example, whereas both Free
Software and Wikipedia have well-documented problems with gender
representation, our patterns describe domain general collaboration
strategies, and can help work against insular trends to help build a
truly inclusive movement. For example, we can connect communities by
sharing a wiki page or software issue with potentially interested
stakeholders who are unfamiliar with the medium, while scaffolding these
“*Newcomers'*” engagement.

Joseph Corneli, PhD (Director of Hyperreal Enterprises, Ltd., based in
Musselburgh) will be involved .5FTE throughout the March-September
programme.

Joe's doctoral thesis (2014) examined “peer produced peer learning” in
the context of PlanetMath.org, an innovative online learning community
for mathematics. He has since completed two postdocs in “computational
creativity” and “social machines”. This proposal combines these research
themes into a practical software system.

Other collaborators within the Peeragogy project will be involved on a
volunteer basis. A “mid-term” report will be submitted to a workshop
associated with the International Conference on Functional Programming,
to be co-written with long-term collaborator Raymond Puzio
(PlanetMath.org, Ltd.).

Joe has previously written about patterns in two papers published in the
Pattern Languages of Programs conference series: “Patterns of Peeragogy”
(2015) and “Patterns of Design” (2017). Joe also brings a good awareness
of the AI space, for example our current project will use methods
similar to recent work by Google Research [1] and NIST [2], and will
allow us to move in the direction of understandable computer code and AI
for programming [3].

I have links to Lorna Campbell on the *Board of Wikimedia UK*, to Jeremy
Knox who co-directs the University of Edinburgh's *Centre for Research
in Digital Education*, and to Neil Mulholland in the *Edinburgh College
of Art*. Mulholland's 2019 book “*Reimagining the Art School: Paragogy
and Artistic Learning*” published with Palgrave builds on ideas that I
developed in my thesis, and provides links to other creative communities
across the UK. Mulholland has invited me to participate in *a creative
arts workshop* that will explore peer learning and peer production in a
Scottish context. Knox has offered to help arrange demos and other
knowledge exchange and impact activities. Wikimedia UK may be able to
support an additional workshop.

I have contacted *Co-operative Development Scotland* to ask for
assistance organizing Hyperreal Enterprises as a co-op, and will liase
with the *Co-operative University* to understand how we can contribute
to their developing initiative.

In parallel with this submission, I have developed a course called
*“Peeragogical Innovations”* that I hope to teach in *Tufts University's
Experimental College* this Autumn. This would be an opportunity to
expand on the themes of this proposal internationally, by engaging
students and invited speakers in further rounds of codesign.
