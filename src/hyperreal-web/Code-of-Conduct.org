  Code of Conduct — Hyperreal Enterprises

  Everybody here is a steward of their own time and interest, and works
  to pursue it.

  The group intersects at any potential points of mutual utility.

  Three ground rules are elaborated below.

  (1) The right to dignity.  Human dignity must be respected and
  protected. Unfortunately, dignity can be violated by acts that lead to
  humiliation, instrumentalization or objectification, degradation, and
  dehumanization. We commit ourselves to avoiding such behaviours, and
  will put any such behaviours to an end if they are made known.

  (2) The golden rule. As a guide, treat others as you would like others
  to treat you. If you have further questions about whether a given
  behaviour upholds the golden rule and the right to dignity, it is
  perfectly fine to ask about it in our code-of-conduct-discussion
  channel. Minor violations do not disqualify participation, though they
  may warrant an apology.

  (3) Disqualifying abusive behaviour. We will put outright abuse to an
  end. We will aim to do this in a way that does the least further harm
  to all parties (however, see point (b) below for one structural
  caveat). Abuse can take the form of manipulation, exploitation,
  maltreatment, neglect, violence, cruelty, harm, hurt, or
  ill-treatment. It can manifest in physical, mental, verbal, emotional,
  financial, sexual, spiritual, or legal dimensions of life. Please
  disclose any instances of abuse to a trusted party and/or the relevant
  authorities.

  While this is not a definitive list, if anyone here experiences any of
  the following, please disclose it so that the situation can be
  resolved: intimidation, isolation, restraint, aggression,
  endangerment; being the target of rage, gaslighting, projection,
  twisting of one’s words, or manipulation; concerning extremes in vocal
  volume and tone, intimidating words, an inappropriately intense manner
  of speech, personal attacks, withholding of apology for wrongdoing,
  browbeating, nitpicking, embarrassment/shame; indicative symptoms
  including increased anxiety, excessive guilt, insecurity, confusion,
  alienation, anger/fear, hostility/rejection.

  While there may be two or more sides to any given story, we will
  strive to take the side of the person with less power in an abusive
  situation.

  Further comments

  First and foremost our organisation is home to “a discussion” and the
  familiar norms of discussion apply. At this stage, organization is
  “bottom-up” — it is more a bazaar than a cathedral. This code of
  conduct along with other matters will be revisited as things evolve.
