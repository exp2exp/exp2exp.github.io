/Research and experimental development on natural sciences and
engineering./

We want to make the knowledge economy accessible to everyone. Web 2.0
hasn't achieved that, though it has produced a large pool of open data.
We will use this data to bootstrap AI tools that support knowledge
workers. Our first product will be an AI tutor that helps people learn
how to program and connects them with practical projects. The next step
will be an AI assistant for professional level teams. Our long-term
vision is computational intelligence based on collective
intelligence.⊕[[https://hyperreal.enterprises/img/raven.png]]

We spent some time “getting out of the building” to talk with potential
users. Here are some of the things we've learned so far:

- [[./seekmentor.html][There is an unmet need for developer helpouts.]]
- [[./fac.html][Peer learning is an effective way to learn how to
  program.]]
- [[./facebook.html][Facebook has “simulating developer communities” in
  their sights.]]

We are also getting on with our research, which is documented on our
[[https://exp2exp.github.io/][wiki]]. Feel free to comment on any of the
pages there (or here) using the hypothes.is sidebar.
