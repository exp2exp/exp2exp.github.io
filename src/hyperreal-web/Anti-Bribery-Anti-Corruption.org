  Anti-bribery policy

  Definition

  Bribery is, in the conduct of the Company’s business, the offering or
  accepting of any gift, loan, payment, reward or advantage for personal
  gain as an encouragement to do something which is dishonest, illegal
  or a breach of trust.

  Bribery is a criminal offence. The Company prohibits any form of
  bribery. We require compliance, from everyone connected with our
  business, with the highest ethical standards and anti-bribery laws
  applicable. Integrity and transparency are of utmost importance to us
  and we have a zero tolerance attitude towards corrupt activities of
  any kind, whether committed by Hyperreal Enterprises Ltd’s employees
  or by third parties acting for or on behalf of Hyperreal Enterprises Ltd.

  Purpose

  The purpose of this policy is to convey to all employees and
  interested parties of Hyperreal Enterprises Ltd the rules of the
  Company in relation to our unequivocal stance towards the eradication
  of bribery and our commitment to ensuring that Hyperreal Enterprises
  Ltd conducts its business in a fair, professional and legal manner.

  Offences

  It is a criminal offence to:

  • offer a bribe
  • accept a bribe
  • bribe a foreign official
  • as a commercial organisation, to fail to prevent a bribe.

  You should be aware that if you are found guilty by a court of
  committing bribery, you could face up to 10 years in prison and/or an
  unlimited fine. The Company could also face prosecution and be liable
  to pay a fine.

  Definitions of bribery and corruption

  Corruption is the misuse of office or power for private gain. Bribery
  is a form of corruption which means in the course of business giving
  or receiving money, gifts, meals, entertainment or anything else of
  value as an inducement to a person to do something which is dishonest
  or illegal.

  Scope

  This policy applies to all employees of Hyperreal Enterprises Ltd,
  regardless of seniority or site. It also extends to anyone working for
  or on our behalf eg those engaged by us on a self-employed basis or an
  agency arrangement.

  We will encourage the application of this policy where our business
  involves the use of third parties eg suppliers; contractors.

  Policy

  It is prohibited, directly or indirectly, to offer, give, request or
  accept any bribe ie gift, loan, payment, reward or advantage, either
  in cash or any other form of inducement, to or from any person or
  company in order to gain commercial, contractual or regulatory
  advantage for the Company, or in order to gain any personal advantage
  for an individual or anyone connected with the individual in a way
  that is unethical.

  It is also prohibited to act in the above manner in order to influence
  an individual in his capacity as a foreign public official. You should
  not make a payment to a third party on behalf of a foreign public
  official.

  If you are offered a bribe, or a bribe is solicited from you, you
  should not agree to it unless your immediate safety is in
  jeopardy. You should immediately contact Joseph Corneli, Director, so
  that action can be taken if considered necessary. You may be asked to
  give a written account of events.

  If you, as an employee or person working on our behalf, suspect that
  an act of bribery, or attempted bribery, has taken place, even if you
  are not personally involved, you are expected to report this to
  contact Joseph Corneli, Director. You may be asked to give a written
  account of events.

  Appropriate checks will be made before engaging with suppliers or
  other third parties of any kind to reduce the risk of our business
  partners breaching our anti- bribery rules.

  The Company will ensure that all of its transactions, including any
  sponsorship or donations given to charity, are made transparently and
  legitimately.  Hyperreal Enterprises Ltd takes any actual or suspected
  breach of this policy extremely seriously and will carry out a
  thorough investigation should any instances arise.We will uphold laws
  relating to bribery and will take disciplinary action against any
  employee, or other relevant action against persons working on our
  behalf or in connection with us, should we find that an act of
  bribery, or attempted bribery, has taken place. This action may result
  in your dismissal if you are an employee, or the cessation of our
  arrangement with you if you are self-employed, an agency worker,
  contractor etc.

  Staff are reminded of the Company’s whistleblowing policy which is
  available in the employee handbook, or upon request.

  Gifts and hospitality

  We realise that the giving and receiving of gifts and hospitality
  where nothing is expected in return helps form positive relationships
  with third parties where it is proportionate and properly
  recorded. This does not constitute bribery and consequently such
  actions are not considered a breach of this policy.  Gifts include
  money; goods (flowers, vouchers, food, drink, event tickets when not
  used in a hosted business context); services or loans given or
  received as a mark of friendship or appreciation.

  Hospitality includes entertaining; meals or event tickets (when used
  in a hosted business context) given or received to initiate or develop
  relations. Hospitality will become a gift if the host is not present.

  No gift should be given nor hospitality offered by an employee or
  anyone working on our behalf to any party in connection with our
  business without receiving prior written approval from Joseph Corneli,
  Director. Similarly, no gift nor offer of hospitality should be
  accepted by an employee or anyone working on our behalf without
  receiving prior written approval from Joseph Corneli, Director.

  A record will be made of every instance in which gifts or hospitality
  are given or received.

  As the law is constantly changing, this policy is subject to review
  and the Company reserves the right to amend this policy without prior
  notice.
