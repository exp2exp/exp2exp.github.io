How did we get here? As a postdoc working on EU and UK research
projects, Joe Corneli developed several proposals for fellowships and
grants:

- [[./ati.html][Q&A for computers (2015)]]
- [[./epsrc.html][Large-Scale Epistemic Agent-based Processes for
  Question Answering (2017)]]
- [[./sfi.html][Complexity Postdoctoral Fellowship (2019)]]
- [[./nesta.html][Peeragogical Pathways (2020)]]

As it happens, none of these were funded. HEL was created to pursue
other routes for funding and delivery. One of the things we've been
doing is marking up these old proposals with some new commentary. And of
course, if at first you don't succeed, try try again.
