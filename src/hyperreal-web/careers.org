Kolmogorov's “calculus of problems” is a strong candidate for a
"theory of FAbstracts". We could switch between rules "if A then B"
and problems, "given A, construct B." Phrased the second way this
leads to the question, what are the actually available tools for
performing the construction. The general answer: whatever primitive
problems we know how to solve. —
