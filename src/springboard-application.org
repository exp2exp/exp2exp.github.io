Title: *Designing urban environments for human health: from the microbiome to the metropolis*

PI: Abby Tabor

* Work Package 2. Embodying a theoretical model: A federated Wiki platform for design

A 3-day symposium: Building a collaborative web-based, design platform for healthy cities

** Day 1. Healthy Cities a: collaborative Design approach

Invited speakers, academics, practitioners (healthcare, public
health), students, general public (live and online). Hosted at Design
West with Nudge Architects, Bristol.

A series of speakers from the fields of architecture, public health,
philosophy, environmental sociology and computational neuroscience
will present around the topic of designing healthy cities.

Focus groups to discuss how to address the gaps between theory and
practice under the remit of health in the city.

** Day 2. Federated Wiki Hackathon (led by Dr Mark Miller & Dr Joe Cornelli-Nested Minds Network LTD & Hyperreal Enterprises)

Invited experts from the fields of computational neuroscience and
computer science will be tasked with creating a user-friendly
Federated Wiki, that will embody a Pattern Language and an Active
Inference.

Framework for the purpose of collaborative, evolving city design.

** Day 3. User testing of collaborative design platform.

A live demonstration and interactive utilisation of the Federated Wiki
platform.  A collaborative effort, honing the platform under the remit
of a city case study focussing on biodiversity and immune
function.  *Emphasis on input from citizens, professionals, experts to
ensure co-creation and usability is addressed.*

** Aim. The creation of a usable online platform (federated wiki) for ongoing collaborative design of health cities.

** Outputs 

- An evolving web-based design platform: Federated Wiki for collaborative designs of healthy cities.
- Peer-reviewed publication: methods
- Peer-reviewed publication: modelling scenarios

** Contracted work
