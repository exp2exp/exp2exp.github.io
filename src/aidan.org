#+TITLE: AIDAN

Joe is facilitating the AI and Data Analysis Network at Oxford
Brookes.  Here are some very rough bullet points that might be
reminiscent of things we’re looking at here at Exp2Exp as well.

- Academic conference data team-building exercise; DA team; data product
- Play, how to help everyone get involved
- Scraping... discuss core themes, pitching ideas
- How broad is AIDAN?
- Schedule custom events once in a while
- Students would benefit from an easy-to-follow weekly or biweekly schedule
- Promote the network with guest seminars (these could be public or non-public)
- What’s the ‘hook’? What’s the ‘journey’ people will go on with AIDAN?
- We could be using media like Youtube or Twitch
- Who can benefit from this?  E.g., HSS to underpin the work here (or vice versa)
- Toby: Adidas HQ speakers
- Good landing page
- Email outreach to nonacademic people to draw them in
- CODE newsletter
