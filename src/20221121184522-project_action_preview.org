As the process of building [[id:7c0dce3b-d5ea-4712-a771-6ff26f143686][A path forward]] develops, the [[id:57d46961-a056-435e-85d2-27ab6e0de7f6][Historian]]
should write down next steps for participants to take after the
workshop.  These actions might help people learn the skills they need
to bring about any beneficial aspects of the scenario (e.g., to
prepare for an adaptive response to a challenging situation).  The
actions may need to be scaffolded by new tools, policies, or other
innovations: write these down, also.
