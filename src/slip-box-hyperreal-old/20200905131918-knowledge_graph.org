Once we have a model of knowledge from Q&A items, e.g., in the form of
triples. we will want to be able to do something with this material.
One way in which it may be useful is in combination with an existing
knowledge graph.  For example, we can look at material from Concept
Net.  We may also have to make some of our own Concept Net-like
graphs.

* Practical work

We can already take some practical steps here, along the lines of the
earlier papers:

- "Modelling the way mathematics is actually done", and
- "Towards mathematical AI via a model of the content and process of mathematical question and answer dialogues".

One possible strategy for further development would be to keep feeding
our [[id:7550513a-ffc0-43c1-924a-02cb4670be67][Forum]] information into this wiki, thinking about the wiki as the
basic grounds for a kind of informal knowledge graph.  This could
potentially relate to the [[id:f266ac5c-6d51-4cd6-ac94-4da17690ffca][Arxana]] project.
