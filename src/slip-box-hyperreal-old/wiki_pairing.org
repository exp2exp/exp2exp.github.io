#+title: Wiki: Pairing

Weâ€™ve tried a couple of methods for effective pairing and group editing.

* Current preferred method

To open up a real-time collaboration (with multiple cursors), use
[[https://code.librehq.com/qhong/crdt.el][crdt.el]], first to serve the buffer:

#+begin_src
M-x crdt-serve-buffer
#+end_src

And then, from your client, to connect:

#+begin_src
M-x crdt-connect
#+end_src

* Older alternative

For syncronized browsing and editing with [[https://github.com/tjim/lockstep][lockstep.el]]:

#+begin_src
ssh pair@178.79.174.58
PW: <ASK JOE FOR THE PASSWORD>
emacsclient -a '' -t
M-x lockstep
#+end_src
