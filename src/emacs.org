#+TITLE: Emacs and Org Mode
#+roam_tags: TO

Some of us have been looking at Emacs and Org Mode, along with other
tools for researchers and knowledge workers. We gave a short talk at
EmacsConf about a preliminary design for an [[file:20200905125342-emacs_hyper_notebook.org][Emacs Hyper Notebook]].  One
of our reasons for starting that project was a sense of
dissatisfaction with what could be achieved with Jupyter; see for
example: [[file:emacs_jupyter_remote_debugging.org][emacs-jupyter remote debugging]].

Some of our subsequent discussions about Emacs and Research appear in [[file:erg.org][Emacs Research Group meeting notes]].

- For convenience, here’s a template: [[file:erg-DD-MM-YYYY.org][DD Month YEAR — Emacs Research Group]]

* What have we here?

This page attempts to create a summary of the themes and ideas we’ve
been surfacing.  It draws on our experiments with Causal Layered Analysis
([[file:cla-20-february-2021.org][CLA 16 January 2021]], [[file:cla-20-february-2021.org][CLA 20 February 2021]], [[file:cla-12-april-2021.org][CLA 12 April 2021]]).

* Remix of our CLA notes and some other outtakes, to turn into a narrative

We’ve made progress since we started with the raw themes of “Research
on/in/with Emacs”.  We’ve had interesting and varied guests, and some
developing plans for the quarter ahead.  We’ve got a workflow with
careful review and diagnosis of issues when expectations aren’t met.
Our work needs to be public first before we can embark on the next
phase of this project — which is to mesh with ongoing related
activities elsewhere.

- Actions are atomic
- /Talking about actualizing what we’re doing/: This keeps popping up, so might be worth discussing tomorrow.
- Annotations and history
- “Bookdown” to create a book in Markdown?
- *Hypothes.is* to have access to WIP (https://via.hypothes.is/https://www.gnu.org/)
- Trying to structure my dissertation, which has many parts; and I have a committee that needs to comment on progress
  - How is the progress of an applicant/researcher measured?
    - Visible outputs of research; // quantifiable research
- We started off with PARs, then we started thinking through our past PARs, then observing /patterns/...
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03736

If we tackle big enough projects, it will bring with it the need for
collaboration (who, what is the itinerary; having places to talk about
research?). While we like to create tangible deliverables (e.g.,
journal articles, rather than half-baked/half-finished publications),
“If we knew what the outcome was it wouldn’t be research” — and we
want to keep a role for serendipity in our work. (Good to have some
people holding the fort; we’re doing fine in terms of turn-out at
weekly meetings!)

- Seeing patterns require a high-level view.
- ‘Patterns’ as ‘projects’; parallels to LV’s workflow?
- How can we make our patterns work in a collaborative fashion?
  - e.g. having similar patterns with Qiantan; how do we share?
  - Linked to /common ground/?  How do we find common ground with people?  Technically speaking, but also methodologically/practice-oriented speaking
- It’s fine to do something that we’re enjoying, but there must be something about actualising.  Even if it were just fun; how can we make it so that even more fun.
- Top-down approach of method vs. the bottom-up approach of practice
- https://hbr.org/2005/07/learning-in-the-thick-of-it
- There’s a /link between method & practice/ that has to do with actualising what we’re doing
- Patterns are the relationships (molecules)
  - E.g, people show up at the protest, but the underlying issue is what the protest is about!
  - Cf. Tim Urban on the /instant gratification monkey/ and /dark playground/
  - E.g. piano, figure skating, swimming, meditation (moving to couples skating and ice-hockey)
  - Consider also the /discriminating mind/, maybe more actively deployed in programming?
  - Deploying collective agency with the body... then bringing things to the level of collected movement: ‘organism’

We have looked at RStudio as a model of (some of) the kinds of things
we want to do (would be great if we got the next big thing up and
running in a year... but this is a lot to ask). ‘Practice’ and
‘method’ keep coming up (respectively, these seem to be more bottom up
and more top down ways of actualising what we’re doing).  We’ve been
focusing on what we’re actually doing, and when we’re clear on that,
we look at which settings are the most conducive. E.g., one method
would be: instead of having a shared Org Roam directory, having ways
of managing sharing of notes across ‘graphs’. (Collaborative work,
academia, writing a book; ORCiD. If we all had our slipboxes on there
we could reference between them. Finding things which are continually
evolving. Maybe it would turn into a Tinder for academics to match
people based on interest... Instead of paying money to go to
conferences! Now we can spontaneously make up conferences. That will
be $750.0 per user...)

- RServer allows collaborative writing and editing, but is expensive ($5000 for 5 users). Compare also RStudio Cloud. For people who use R as their main language, they use this.
- We could schedule a person specialised on R-Studio to come present us the piece of software (à la Google Doc presentation)
- Learn from parallel projects; Mark had video introducing people to Spacemacs

- CLA is useful as a reflective tool but there are others as well!
- Requires a larger community of contributors for it to work.
- How do we differentiate authorship in those notes?
- Expectations might not be met, but we are practicing the things that we’ve learnt; it’s what makes it systematic (the machine that builds itself again).

- Methods are the intention (in Buddhism, there’s /right intention/)
  - E.g., sensory mind and discriminating mind as kidney-shaped entities within the mind.
  - Method of how you practice

What gives an objective character to what we’re doing? (Noting also
that time is going by; things that were timely 7 years ago might not
be timely now; the actual relevance goes down.) Or, rather: what is it
that allows us to synthesise new relationships? What big or
‘existential’ problem are we solving... we’re not pushing ourselves
beyond what’s humanly possible, but we are pushing ourselves to learn.

- *Now* (30th January) we try to integrate *my* (Noorah’s) thoughts on a set of notes that we create together across time. How does this work? — But do we care about this in our workflow?  We could keep track of who created what with properties: do we want/need to persist these things? All the CRDT logs to file?
- Saving the buffer with the text properties could do it.
- What problem are we trying to solve?

- Decide on a few tangible activities/deliverables — but this can also take an ‘agile’ approach.

- Would need a 4th level to account for ‘end’
  - Red and yellow scores for skating
  - How well did you execute it in the case of a quasi-unexpected circumstance? (Compare also the use of data analysis in football.)
  - In Buddhism, putting an end to ‘fabrications’

* Some further coffee chat follow-up thoughts: concrete things

- Org-super-agenda
- Patterns
- Routine
