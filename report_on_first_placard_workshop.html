The first thing we do is communicate the kaiju.  Make a concrete scenario.  E.g., in this world, we don’t have the same infrastructure, there may be shortages (e.g., </span><strong><span>coffee</span></strong><span>).  The next stage is the history stage, thinking about </span><strong><span>what is the history that led up to this</span></strong><span> (because of no longer having international networks, there’s very little being exported).  Using this to think about scenarios for the future as well as a strategy that people might use.   What are the </span><strong><span>forces</span></strong><span> at the systems layer?  (They emphasised this at PLoP.)  What are the worldviews and metaphors associated with that?  A default sequence might go like this (roughly this is what we did).  But these things can have multiple answers.</span></p><ul><li><p><strong><span>Conference Kaiju</span></strong><span> :: They might extend the deadline</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Historical background for this</span></strong><span> :: Globally, we’re in the middle of a global pandemic; also, in our immediate experience, we worked on the Futures paper, we’ve been doing related things with ERG, Peeragogy, Hyperreal</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Forces</span></strong><span>: We can’t spend 80 hours a week on this thing because we’ve already committed to other things</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Metaphors</span></strong><span>: In the paper we talked about metaphors to do with ERG, distributed networks; we didn’t have much say in how PLoP was organised but we could have suggested to do it the PLACARD way.  We could have also pulled the effort out of the workshop and pushed it to November.</span></p></li></ul></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="ok,-so-on-this-basis,-what-is-our-actual-plan-for-what-to-do-next?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>OK, so on this basis, what is our actual plan for what to do next?</span></span></h2><section><ul><li><p><span>Regarding making something useful: our objective within the workshop was to put things together to show an example.  Then participants can come up with additional useful ideas outside of the workshop.</span></p></li><li><p><span>One brainstormed strategy for finding our own next steps would be to report back to the sources of the materials we used and ask them for some help!</span></p></li><li><p><span>I like the idea of trying something simpler: we could keep the same roles and how they think, but run them in simpler scenarios.  E.g., not everyone is familiar with climate change patterns, planning for a city; but we could do it with the pizza shop scenario.</span></p></li></ul></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="schedule-of-events"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Schedule of events</span></span></h1><section><ul><li><p><span>Thursday Oct. 14th :: Workshop tupperware party (store things for 12 days)</span></p></li><li><p><span>Saturday Oct. 16th :: ERG — Submit talk, start to script of talk</span></p></li><li><p><span>Tuesday Oct. 19th  :: </span><strong><span>Break</span></strong><span> from workshop activities</span></p></li><li><p><span>Thursday Oct. 21th :: </span><strong><span>Break</span></strong><span> from workshop activities</span></p></li><li><p><span>Saturday Oct. 23rd :: ERG — Talk preparation, finalise script of talk</span></p></li><li><p><span>Tuesday Oct. 26th  :: </span><strong><span>Break</span></strong><span> from workshop activities</span></p></li><li><p><span>Thursday Oct. 28th :: </span><strong><span>Come back to do one more day of workshop prep</span></strong></p></li><li><p><span>Saturday Oct. 30th :: ERG — (Aim to) </span><strong><span>Finalise recording by this date</span></strong></p></li><li><p><span>Tuesday Nov. 30th  :: Run cleaned-up version of workshop with Brookes (Joe to schedule with IEAI)</span></p></li><li><p><span>Sat-Sun.
