place in ‘conversations’.  I think about how this creates a certain
landscape, with some things in focus and other blindspots.  I then
think about how this resembles physical systems which have activation
thresholds — and other kinds of thresholds — relative to their
landscape.  </span><em><span>Evolutionary</span></em><span> systems in particular do the work of
‘discovering’ certain thresholds within their environments.  Our
ability to talk and think about evolution (on the one hand), and
patterns (on the other) is perplexed by the fact that we are ourselves
engaged in ‘emergent’ behaviour when we do so.  The tools, mindsets,
and abilities that we deploy as we relate to the process of
‘discovery’ all need to be thought about somewhat circumspectly.  We
want to create a sense of perplexity while also having the methods at
our disposal for making sense of it in due course.  Deploying language
to make meaning relative to a background landscape is only the
incremental </span><strong><span>PARticle</span></strong><span> of meaning-making; the aggregate needs to be
discussed more later on.</span></p></section></div></div><embed height="600px" src="https://hyperreal.enterprises/docs/2021-04-25.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="100%" /><hr /><div class="back"><p>Back to blog: <a href="https://exp2exp.github.io/Writing">Exp2Exp: Writing</a></p></div></article></main></body></html>
