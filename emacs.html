on/in/with Emacs”.  We’ve had interesting and varied guests, and some
developing plans for the quarter ahead.  We’ve got a workflow with
careful review and diagnosis of issues when expectations aren’t met.
Our work needs to be public first before we can embark on the next
phase of this project — which is to mesh with ongoing related
activities elsewhere.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Actions are atomic</span></p></li><li><p><em><span>Talking about actualizing what we’re doing</span></em><span>: This keeps popping up, so might be worth discussing tomorrow.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Annotations and history</span></p></li><li><p><span>“Bookdown” to create a book in Markdown?</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Hypothes.is</span></strong><span> to have access to WIP (https://via.hypothes.is/https://www.gnu.org/)</span></p></li><li><p><span>Trying to structure my dissertation, which has many parts; and I have a committee that needs to comment on progress</span></p><ul><li><p><span>How is the progress of an applicant/researcher measured?</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Visible outputs of research; // quantifiable research</span></p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><span>We started off with PARs, then we started thinking through our past PARs, then observing </span><em><span>patterns</span></em><span>...</span></p></li><li><p><span>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03736</span></p></li></ul><p><span>If we tackle big enough projects, it will bring with it the need for
collaboration (who, what is the itinerary; having places to talk about
research?). While we like to create tangible deliverables (e.g.,
journal articles, rather than half-baked/half-finished publications),
“If we knew what the outcome was it wouldn’t be research” — and we
want to keep a role for serendipity in our work. (Good to have some
people holding the fort; we’re doing fine in terms of turn-out at
weekly meetings!)</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Seeing patterns require a high-level view.</span></p></li><li><p><span>‘Patterns’ as ‘projects’; parallels to LV’s workflow?</span></p></li><li><p><span>How can we make our patterns work in a collaborative fashion?</span></p><ul><li><p><span>e.g. having similar patterns with Qiantan; how do we share?</span></p></li><li><p><span>Linked to </span><em><span>common ground</span></em><span>?

we want to do (would be great if we got the next big thing up and
running in a year... but this is a lot to ask). ‘Practice’ and
‘method’ keep coming up (respectively, these seem to be more bottom up
and more top down ways of actualising what we’re doing).  We’ve been
focusing on what we’re actually doing, and when we’re clear on that,
we look at which settings are the most conducive. E.g., one method
would be: instead of having a shared Org Roam directory, having ways
of managing sharing of notes across ‘graphs’. (Collaborative work,
academia, writing a book; ORCiD. If we all had our slipboxes on there
we could reference between them. Finding things which are continually
evolving. Maybe it would turn into a Tinder for academics to match
people based on interest... Instead of paying money to go to
conferences! Now we can spontaneously make up conferences. That will
be $750.0 per user...)</span></p><ul><li><p><span>RServer allows collaborative writing and editing, but is expensive ($5000 for 5 users). Compare also RStudio Cloud.

(Noting also
that time is going by; things that were timely 7 years ago might not
be timely now; the actual relevance goes down.) Or, rather: what is it
that allows us to synthesise new relationships? What big or
‘existential’ problem are we solving... we’re not pushing ourselves
beyond what’s humanly possible, but we are pushing ourselves to learn.</span></p><ul><li><p><strong><span>Now</span></strong><span> (30th January) we try to integrate </span><strong><span>my</span></strong><span> (Noorah’s) thoughts on a set of notes that we create together across time.
