do with language we seem to have preferred quantity to coherence or
development.  Another take on the question of how to see the coherence

mean to look at the future.  Whereas we are grounded in the present,
and we have a circumspect if somewhat dim view of the past, we seem
embarassed about the future.  And yet if we think about it again, the
future offers us many good things (here, a bit like </span><em><span>Roadside Picnic</span></em><span>).

might think; and opening ourselves to the future.</span></p></section></div></div><embed height="600px" src="https://hyperreal.enterprises/docs/2021-05-01.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="100%" /><hr /><div class="back"><p>Back to blog: <a href="https://exp2exp.github.io/Writing">Exp2Exp: Writing</a></p></div></article></main></body><script>anchors.options = {
