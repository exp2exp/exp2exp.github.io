the Emacs Research Group, we gained a lot of experience working across
disciplines.  Building on our long-running small-group experience, we
developed a strategy for engaging others in the kind of light creative
work that we value, because we want to share our patterns for building
effective joyful action.</span></p><p><span>Our new day-long workshop brings people together around a topic of
shared interest.  We use a scenario-development and exploration
process to help participants understand their common ground, and
discover new ways to work together.  In this talk, we will give an
overview of recent workshops we’ve run, on themes linked to public
space and future studies, and how we utilize Emacs for our research.</span></p><p><span><20 minutes: (brief description/outline)</span></p><p><span>[All of the above and...]</span></p><p><span>Looking back at our recent pilots as a source of evidence, we’ll look
at whether and how the methods we used helped people quickly identify
core themes that they want to keep working on together.  While we
don’t expect everyone to meet weekly like we did, we do expect that
some participants will leave energised.  Underlying the workshop is
the claim that the right combination of methods should help people
find topics of priority that they want to get traction on it, for
example, breaking down a topic like "public space" into doable actions
like cleaning up an abandoned lot.  Does the evidence so far support
this claim?</span></p><p><span>We also reflect on how technology — including further evolution of
Emacs — could help people be even more effective at identifying and
addressing challenging problems.  As a small example, note-taking in
real time with CRDT helps us practice ‘active listening’ in our
meetings and gives us a detailed record of what happened that we can
return to for further reflection and analysis.  As we think about the
other affordances of Emacs, we get excited about how more advanced
data analysis and more structured interaction patterns could aid in
going back over our old thoughts and getting more out of the time we
spend together.  One potential application would be forming bridges
between the different community groups we work with.</span></p><p><span><40 minutes: (brief description/outline)</span></p><p><span>[All of the above and...]</span></p><p><span>In our workshop design, Phase 1 is a descent to a shared Myth, which
comprises an understanding of common ground; Phase 2 is about moving
from that into effective action.</span></p><p><span>We’ll bring these ideas together to introduce our plans for a day-long
workshop specifically for Emacs users and developers.  We want to work
together to imagine the future of Emacs.  In this setting,
participants will begin with considerable technical common ground, as
well as community with a long history of effective collaboration.
Nevertheless, Emacs presents both challenges (especially for new
users) and many interesting opportunities.  This talk constitutes an
invitation, and we hope to get your feedback on the kind of workshop
you’d be excited to attend, before we run it (in about a month!).</span></p></blockquote></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="break"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>BREAK</span></span></h1></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="agenda-(part-2)---discussion-of-org-roam-features"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Agenda (Part 2) - Discussion of Org Roam features</span></span></h1><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="checkin-fromwith-newcomers"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Checkin from/with newcomers</span></span></h2><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="lv"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>LV</span></span></h3><section><ul><li><p><span>Summing up Emacsconf from last week</span></p></li><li><p><span>Exploring what was possible with Obsidian, Org Roam, Roam Research -like software</span></p></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="at"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>AT</span></span></h3><section><ul><li><p><span>Here for 4PM, but calendar said 3PM</span></p></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="ft"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>FT</span></span></h3><section><ul><li><p><span>Doing super</span></p></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="ja"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>JA</span></span></h3><section><ul><li><p><span>Initially here with headphones only?</span></p></li></ul></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="presentation-of-slipboxes,-going-more-into-technical-stuff"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Presentation of slipboxes, going more into technical stuff</span></span></h2><section><ul><li><p><span>We previously checked out the common ground with Korsakow, and his thinking about narratives</span></p></li><li><p><span>We can show you now what Org Roam does, and why it makes it easy for us to develop any kind of workflow</span></p></li><li><p><span>We have individual SBs</span></p></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="demo-part-1"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Demo Part 1</span></span></h2><section><ul><li><p><span>We have files with unique titles</span></p></li><li><p><span>We can display a fancy collection of constellactions</span></p></li><li><p><span>E.g., you can click on a note and see the connections coming out</span></p></li><li><p><span>Looking at "note-taking" in Emacs we get an update of the files connected to "note-taking"</span></p></li><li><p><span>These kinds of tools allow you to link things together</span></p></li><li><p><span>But we have a different collection of notes for our meeting notes;
