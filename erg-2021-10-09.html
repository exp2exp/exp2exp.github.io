"Hey this is what we did this whole year, this is how we talk about Emacs... and then take it from there."  And we can use this talk, the details of it, to explore what we want to do next.  E.g., to digest the whole year, try to figure out what happened and what needs to happen.</span></p></li><li><p><span>RP: The historical angle makes sense here.  Like in a PLoP keynote, we could have discussion amongst the participants to give a little sense of what it’s like to be at one of these meetings.</span></p></li><li><p><span>LV: Joe had talked about how we might be able to use the Flaws workshop for something else.  Similarly how would this talk help with our goals?  As a 1-year-anniversary we can present ourselves... from a meta perspective, I’d love if in the next 25 minutes we could write the blurb.

We thought we might want to
write a whitepaper as an output.  We met approximately weekly up until
the summer holiday, and resumed afterward.  We had several guest
attendees over the weeks.  We took notes on each meeting using a new
‘conflict-free replicated data type’ package (CRDT).  We did a Project
Action Review (PAR) at the end of each meeting.  We prepared a Causal
Layered Analysis (CLA) of our meetings.  We wrote up our experiences
as a case study within a joint submission to the Pattern Languages of
Programs Conference (PLoP 2021).  We also prepared and delivered an
interactive workshop related at that conference.</span></p><p><span>We can now understand the roles we used in our workshop in relation to
the roles that we are taking in our ERG meetings; e.g., situational
reports (sitreps) from a ‘Kaiju Communicator’, or topic modelling from
a ‘Designer’; and can we make use of the information about where
conflict appears through the thinking of an ‘Analyst’?</span></p><p><span>Going forward we’re inspired by the Gilliam-linked documentaries "Lost
in La Mancha?" and "</span><a class="firn-external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_Who_Killed_Don_Quixote#He_Dreams_of_Giants" target="_blank">He Dreams of Giants</a><span>" and the </span><strong><span>Kenneth Cole
Productions</span></strong><span> story.  We can think of our experience as a movie trailer
parked next to the EmacsConf station.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>5-10 minutes: (brief description/outline)</span></p></li><li><p><span>20 minutes: (brief description/outline)</span></p></li><li><p><span>40 minutes: (brief description/outline)</span></p></li></ul><p><span>Availability and preferred Q&A approach:</span></p><p><span>Speaker release: XXX</span></p></blockquote></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="pause"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>PAUSE</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#5m">5m</a></span></span></h2></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="overflow-for-emacsconf"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Overflow for EmacsConf</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#25m">25m</a></span></span></h2></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="prepare-the-debrief-plop"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Prepare the debrief PLoP</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#10m">10m</a></span></span></h2><section><p><span>OBJECTIVE: Have a plan for the debrief session on </span><span class="firn-timestamp">2021/10/120</span><span> (UTC)</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Started with a paper for Futures </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03736" target="_blank">Patterns, anticipation and participatory futures</a><span>; this new submission one got accepted</span></p></li><li><p><span>We did incorporate some of what we thought about with ERG</span></p></li><li><p><span>Another thing that came up along the way (with ERG)</span></p></li><li><p><span>Thinking about the overlaps (is this an ERG thing, Hyperreal, Peeragogy?</span></p></li><li><p><span>Thinking about future materials for the workshop.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Thinking about rôles in terms of scalability: Who is going to be doing what going forward?</span></p></li><li><p><span>Can we make some approximations around what our availability is going to be on several timelines</span></p></li><li><p><span>There was some strife along different levels… somewhat stressful for all of us; so… what can we learn from this?</span></p></li><li><p><span>The stife does have something to do with our transdisciplinary work, and outside commitments</span></p></li><li><p><span>This means we have to be more deliberate than people who were only focused on one thing</span></p></li><li><p><span>We started to get future-oriented future into our ways of thinking; i.e., ‘how would we like season 1 to go’; ‘what do we want to deliver a year from now?’</span></p></li><li><p><span>Can we retrospectively apply ‘scenarios’ to PLoP? E.g., the Optimistic scenario of nearly-on-schedule, clearly-coordinated, which would allow us to seamlessly do our paper, workshop, campfire talk.
