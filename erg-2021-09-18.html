on/in/with Emacs</span></strong><span> back in December 2020.  We’ve met almost every week
since then, and interviewed some interesting and varied guests.  We
have a clearer idea of what we want to talk about at the next
EmacsConf, and how we can be of service to researchers and Emacs
users.  We have been using a workflow that helps us carefully review
progress, diagnose issues, and manage our energy.  The next phase of
this project is to “go public” and mesh with ongoing related
activities elsewhere, including by getting some training events up and
running.</span></p><p><span>If we tackle big enough projects, it will bring with it the need for
collaboration.  We like to create tangible deliverables (e.g. journal
articles). However, “If we knew what the outcome was, it wouldn’t be
research”—therefore, we’re focusing initially on research methods
and design documents. That may result in a longer time to write
initial papers, but when something is released it is more thoroughly
prepared. Meanwhile, we keep our skills sharp by fixing bugs,
improving our own workflows, and actively exploring the landscape. All
these activities are part of the system we implement regularly, which
minimizes technical debt and allows space for serendipity to occur.</span></p><p><span>We have looked at RStudio and Roam Research as models of (some of) the
kinds of things we think Emacs can learn from and eventually improve upon.
‘Practice’ and ‘method’ keep coming up in our discussions as,
respectively, ‘more bottom up’ and ‘more top down’ ways of actualizing
things.  Concretely, we’ve been studying our own processes and looking
for the tools and settings that are the most conducive to the work we
want to do.  For example, instead of having a single Org Roam
directory shared via Git, what if we had ways of managing sharing of
notes across ‘graphs’?</span></p><p><span>Collaboration is familiar to teams across all domains. Even authors
working alone will collaborate with their past and future selves. What
is common for all collaborators is that the transfer of information
must be uninhibited.  If we all had our slipboxes online, we could
interlink them.</span><a class="firn-footnote-ref" href="#" id="fn-"><sup></sup></a><span>  This would generalize </span><strong><span>ORCiD</span></strong><span>, and allow people to
reference processes that are undergoing evolution.  Maybe a service
like this would turn into a ‘Tinder for academics’—helping to match
people based on their interests (or similar people in different
fields).  So, what’s the price point?  Instead of paying money to go
to conferences, now we can spontaneously make conferences and
workshops.  As a guess, $750.0 per user per year might be a fair price—for those who can afford to pay it—if the service helps people to
do better research and saves a bunch of travel.  We could also set up
a pricing model proportional to each country’s carbon emissions or
something like that.</span></p><p><span>In our concrete methods, we have aligned ourselves with the ‘</span><a class="firn-external" href="https://longtermist.substack.com/" target="_blank">long-term
perspective</a><span>’.  This includes both retrospective and prospective
thinking.  For example, the things that were timely 7 years ago might
not be so timely now; in many cases the relevance of a given
innovation goes down over time.  However, Emacs has an evolutionary
character that has allowed it to keep up with the times—becoming
more relevant and useful ever since Steele and Stallman started to
systematize </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://www.oreilly.com/openbook/freedom/ch06.html" target="_blank">Editor MACroS</a><span> for the Text Editor and Corrector (TECO)
program.  Not only has the technology evolved, but so has the social
setting in which this work is done.  Whereas the concepts underlying
the free software movement were based on “</span><a class="firn-external" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-paper.html" target="_blank">communal sharing</a><span>” of source
code, these methods can be extended and allow us to synthesize new
relationships within broader semiotic commons.  Emacs can become part
of a system for addressing large-scale existential problems, by
expanding the frontier of what’s possible for human beings.</span></p></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="40m-demo-+-20m-of-question-time"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>40m demo + 20m of question time</span></span></h3><section><ul><li><p><span>To be developed over next 3 weeks, assuming we spend some time later polishing the proposal!</span></p></li><li><p><span>One of them can be "Going Public" — what are the others?</span></p></li></ul></section></div></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="par"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>PAR</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#10m">10m</a></span></span></h1><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="1-review-the-intention:-what-did-we-expect-to-learn-or-make-together?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>1.
